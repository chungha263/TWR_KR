From the pride of the fleet it has become the joke of the fleet.

Our Primary region of interest is in the Mediterranean, we conduct regular patrols in the Mediterranean , our major naval bases are too few, often ships at sea which suffer accidents or malfunction need to move to the nearest foreign naval base even if our territories are closer. This is due to them not having necessary facilities to conduct repairs.

Mussolini was declared dead today at 8:22 am.\n\nOn waking up at 6:22 am our Duce had his usual cup of coffee and then read an excerpt from 'Bellum Gallicum' (he did so every day). At 7:02 am he received a visit from his daughter, Edda Ciano who stayed for about an hour. Following that Il Duce went for a walk in the garden. It is in the garden that a servant found Il Duce dead.\n\nIt was initially supposed that Mussolini had killed himself: he had exhibited strong signs in the past weeks. Il Duce had a panic attack a few weeks ago after being attacked by a dog with rabbies. From there on he progressively became worse: he became obsessed with Julius Caesar, pretending to be him, he started drinking large quantities of peach juice and cursed without restraint. Furthermore during the night he often used to accuse a myriad of people ranging from Merlin the Wizard to Adolf Hitler for his removal from power. Yet the supposition of suicide was excluded as the autopsy revealed the cause was probably a heart attack.\n\n That having being said, although the official stance is that Il Duce died of natural causes, there have been suspicions that these were not so natural. A wide array of rumours are circulating in the inner circles of the PNF: that Mussolini's early demise would profit Balbo and Ciano. Nonetheless such talks are to be squashed as they are nothing but mere lies.\n\n With Mussolini's death the necessary preparations for the funeral will have to happen and then the Grand Council of Fascism will meet to decide on the next Duce, who is expected to be the one handpicked personally by Mussolini.\n\nWhile it is certainly a distressing event that our great leader has passed, few were hugely surprised. Isolated by his family, friends and former entourage, the once messiniac figure of Italian fascism died as a shadow of its former self. That is the price to pay for power, and the price to pay for failure. Perhaps Il Duce will one day will rank as a tragic figure himself, to the likes of Marc Anthony, Frederick Barbarossa or Julian.

I am here to liberate, as did Augustus when he sent the vermins, Brutus and Marc Anthony, to their fate, and he himself, Augustus, brought Rome to its golden age. I have thus removed two scums, Benito and Italo, and although the leeches have escaped, they are irrelevant anymore.\n\n    Today a new era begins, where we lay behind our past. Fascist will be reborn under a new noble and human face, that of Aristocratic Fascism, where men will only be defined by their worth and it is their worth which will determine their status in society. The brave and fortuous shall be Kings, and the weak rats will be the Serfs.\n\n     And as a matter of fact, the 'Kingdom of Italy' is abolished once for all, and instead we may now call ourselves the Empire of Italy led by myself as the Imperator of the Empire. Imperator not in the twisted definition the contemporary royals have given to the title, but Imperator in the sense of ancients, when the Emperors of the past lived their life in the battlefield and sought to create what is called the illustrious 'Roman Empire'.\n\n     My goal is not to promote any silly nationalist concept, or anything like that. No, us Italians are fit to rule the world because that is our role, and it is our mission to do so. Whoever submits to Rome willfully will become one of the Romans, whoever does not, well he better flee the advance of the Legions!\n\n     Now the time has come to fullfill our destiny. Ave Caesar.

    twritalynewsevents.1.d:0 "For several days now, strikes had been spiralling out of the Italian Government's control in Bergamo. Now, however, it seems Rome resolved to put these to an end whatever it takes. The Italian army was deployed in force to break up the strikes, with tanks rolling through the streets. Many shots have been fired, resulting in the deaths of many protestors. News of crackdown is sparce, likely due to an Italian coverup, but what's for sure is it has been an altogether bloody affair.\n\nFor now, the strikes have been ended and order restored, but such an extreme show of force could easily lead to great resentment and instability in the near future."

One hundred thousand armed insurgents supported by most of the civilian population have declared war against Italy and its puppet government.\n       The rebels have fought for years the Italians as part of a guerrila campaign and have managed to seize the country's mountainous areas but have been unable to capture the valuable coastal and urban areas. With this uprising the Greeks hope that they will be able to overwhelm the Italians and at last liberate Greece from the foreign yoke.\n       So far Greece is on its own and no country has expressed, at least openly, any support for the rebels. However public opinion in most anti-Fascist countries is in favour of Greece \n       The insurgents are an amalgalm of the various rebel groups which are Communist/Socialist, the Liberal or Monarchist. The different resistance groups are united under the leadership of Nikolaos Plastiras. The unity of the rebels is, however, ephemeral, and should Greece win its fight, a new one may begin afterwards..."

Now, those hopes have been seemingly destroyed, as the Italian puppet in Greece has defeated most of the rebel forces and regained control over most of the country.

Most members of the Toronto Accord have condemned Italy with [USA.GetLeader] calling Borghese a 'criminal scum'. Already British forces in Malta, Cyprus and the Suez have been mobilised for a potential surprise attack by Italy. [GER.GetLeader] on the other hand has remained quiet on the issue.

    JUNIO_BORGHESE_DESC:0 "Vice Admiral Don Junio Valerio Borghese, Patrician of Rome, Naples and Venice is an enigmatic and intriguing figure. Born to one of Rome's oldest noble families, the House of Borghese, he was nurtured into a life of luxury early on. In 1929 however he decided to join the Regia Marina and from there on promotions followed quickly: in 1933 appointed submarine commander, serving in Ethiopia and in Spain.\n\nHe quickly distinguished himself as an apt commander and when the war with the United Kingdom erupted he was appointed commander of the elite Decima Flotiglia MAS, where he piooneered naval commando's. Despite the short war, Borghese was able to achieve great success by causing severe damage to British and French ships. After the end of the war, Borghese was from done with his fight. He applied to volunteer with the German Kriegsmarine to destroy the Red threat once for all. His service in the Baltic Sea was once again a great success and he even managed to sink a Soviet battleship. He won the German Pour le Mérite on special intervention by Karl Dönitz, becoming the most recent foreigner to earn the prestigious order.\n\nBorghese's experience in the war had however changed him. He realised how backwards the Italian people were, only mere shadows of Ancient Rome, he realised how antiquated a monarchy was which was based on some worthless titles. Borghese set out to work on his master plan for the rebirth of Rome out of Italy's ashes and at the same time destroy what he perceives as the 'Anglo-Germanic Hegemony'. He envisions an Aristocratic Imperial Fascist State where every man is judged based only on his abilities. Borghese wants to recreate the societal structure of Ancient Rome but with the only distinction being merit. And indeed Borghese wants Italians to dedicate themselves to war and empire building with as much ruthlessness as their ancestors. And he will do everything possible to ensure Rome is reborn..."

Sicily is the largest island on the Mediterranean Sea located on the southernmost extremity of the Italian peninsula. It has a very rich history starting with the Greek and Phoenician colonisation, the Roman conquest and then the Norman, Byzantine, Arab, Spanish and Bourbon periods ending with the unification of Italy in 1861. Sicily has never been entirely loyal to the Kingdom due to the fierce nature of its inhabitants and the persistent misery predominant in the countryside.

From Romans both East and West to the Franks, and even to the Ottomans, Hungarians, and Austrians, before the region was divided between Italy and Yugoslavia following the First World War.
