#Description
 EZEKIAS_DESC:0 "The Secretary General of the AKEL is a true working class hero, in being a part of it for most of his life. Born in a village of less than two hundred, he personally experienced the struggle of the rural farmer. Unable to receive higher schooling without his brother's financial support, he realized that education, even now, was a privilege that only the well off would ever receive. Forced to move to Nicosia due to health concerns, he witnessed that healthcare, too, was something that could not be obtained without playing the game of capitalism. Finally, he toiled as both dock worker and a miner, hard labor that truly made him part of the proletariat. These experiences molded him into the man he is today, for throughout all of his struggles, he found one consistent chance at salvation: Communism. \n\nFrom there, Ezekias Papaioannou became a true believer in internationalism: Battling Fascist groups politically in London, then literally in Spain. He attempted to battle against the German menace, even if that meant fighting for his colonial overlords, and was only rejected due to the injuries he experienced in the Spanish Civil War. After Germany crushed the armies of free Europe, he returned to his homeland, intent on bringing the revolution to his own nation before anywhere else. The struggle against colonialism was long and hard, with the British he once tried to fight for arresting and imprisoning him and many others of his party. But he never stopped struggling, escaping from his jailors and continuing the battle; one he eventually won, clearly and decisively. \n\nNow elected to rule over a now independent Cyprus, Ezekias' policies are that of anti-fascism, equality between Greek and Turk Cypriots, and above all else, bringing Marxist-Leninism to Cyprus."

 twrcyprus.1.t:0 "Mass Arrests of AKEL Members in Cyprus"
 twrcyprus.1.d:0 "Having been declared illegal due to its actions and anti-British rhetoric, AKEL, the Cypriot Communist Party has now had 135 of its members arrested by our local police. They have long been a nuisance to our governance over the island and this clear sweep of their members will alleviate some of the weight on our necks.\n\nThe recent arrests have not been without issue although, with protests slowly popping up around the island. Our police forces have been keeping the protests under control for now but it seems we have been walking a fine line."
 twrcyprus.1.a:0 "Darned communists..."
 
 twrcyprus.2.t:0 "Anti-Colonial Protests in Cyprus"
 twrcyprus.2.d:0 "Mass Anti-Colonial and Anti-British protests have been going on in our colony in Cyprus. Fuelled by the many years of colonial subjugation and the recent arrests carried out by the police, the people of Cyprus have been demanding that Britain leave the island immediately.\n\nUnited under the Cypriot Banner, the AKEL, the Church and the EOKA have been rallying for an independent Cyprus for many years now but with little results thanks to our control over the island. But now the situation has become critical and we must act now or face a potential revolt."
 twrcyprus.2.a:0 "Call the Cypriots to Discuss."
 twrcyprus.2.b:0 "Put down the Protests."
 
 twrcyprus.3.t:0 "The Meeting of Leukosia"
 twrcyprus.3.d:0 "It seems our calls for peaceful discussion have come to fruition. Representatives from all sides of the Cypriot independence movement have arrived, with Ezekias Papaioannou for the AKEL, Grigoris Afxentious for EOKA and Archbishop Makarios as a representative of the Church and other factions. With their presence our ambitions for minor and empty reforms fell out, as all demanded independence for Cyprus.\n\nWith our hands tied and with our choices being limited, we must either go down the path of letting go or compromise."
 twrcyprus.3.a:0 "Give the Cypriots their Independence."
 twrcyprus.3.b:0 "Cyprus for the Cypriots."
 twrcyprus.3.c:0 "Form the Cypriot Autonomous Republic."
 
 twrcyprus.4.t:0 "Armed Riots Break Out in Leukosia"
 twrcyprus.4.d:0 "Despite the efforts of our police force, the protests have now turned into violent riots, with gunfights becoming a common occurrence. Militia of the EOKA and AKEL have been fighting our soldiers and officers through the streets and losses on both sides have been rising. We are at a standstill but the situation turns more and more grim with every moment.\n\nNow all we can do is continue fighting until the final moment."
 twrcyprus.4.a:0 "It seems the line has been crossed."
 
 twrcyprus.5.t:0 "To the Brink of War"
 twrcyprus.5.d:0 "Leukosia has now turned into a warzone. Constant fighting has been common and the Cypriot militias have been amassing more and more as time goes on. The situation has gone critical and our forces in Cyprus have been pushed more and more to their limits. The Cypriot flag has been flying over the capital of Leukosia for a few days now and our grasp over the island seems like a thin line ready to break by a single breath.\n\nNow it is our final option between peace and war. For the Empire or for Peace."
 twrcyprus.5.a:0 "Let the Cypriots go..."
 twrcyprus.5.b:0 "The Sun will not set over Cyprus!"
 twrcyprus.5.c:0 "Down with the British Chains!"
 
 twrcyprus.6.t:0 "Order in Cyprus Once More"
 twrcyprus.6.d:0 "The streets are now washed in blood and gunpowders. Walls are riddled with holes and windows are but a past memory. Bodies of soldiers and militiamen are piled on top of each other. A bloody battle, a costly war. But its now over.\n\nThe British Empire has come on top once more over its unruly subjects and has managed to hold on to its colonies. Let this be a lesson to the Cypriots and to all those who oppose us."
 twrcyprus.6.a:0 "We will never surrender!"
 
 twrcyprus.7.t:0 "The Loss of the Island"
 twrcyprus.7.d:0 "As the British banner is lowered for the last time and our remaining soldiers return home, we wave goodbye to our colony in the Eastern Mediterranean. The sorrowful sight of our faultering Empire will haunt us but we must push on."
 twrcyprus.7.a:0 "Keep calm and carry on..."
 
 twrcyprus.8.t:0 "Cyprus Sees the Light of Day"
 twrcyprus.8.d:0 "The streets are now washed in blood and gunpowders. Walls are riddled with holes and windows are but a past memory. Bodies of soldiers and militiamen are piled on top of each other. A bloody battle, a costly war. But its now over.\n\nThe Cypriot people could not be suppressed and their valiant sacrifice was awarded with their independence. Let this be a lesson to those who wished to see Cyprus under their boot."
 twrcyprus.8.a:0 "Liberty or Death!"
 
 twrcyprus.9.t:0 "The First Free Elections"
 twrcyprus.9.d:0 "With the Cypriot banner flying high, it is now time for Cypriots to decide upon the next President of the country through the means of democracy, something that the British had deprived us of. The people hang the Cypriot flag from their houses and from poles all across the country as election day arrives. \n\nWith only two primary parties up for election, the people of Cyprus are not given many choices. \n\nOn one hand, the Marxist-Leninist AKEL led by Ezekias Papaioannou represents the workers and their interests, with its agenda focusing on a nationalised economy and a united federation state for both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Supported by most of the working class, the AKEL has been criticised by many of the right and left wing despite their work in the anti-colonial fight against Britain. \n\nOn the other hand, EOKA and its many factions, led by Makarios the III represent a vaster majority of Cypriots from all classes but primarily the Greek Cypriots. With an agenda of free market economics and it's domestic policy a major infighting point between the more liberal and the more conservative members of the party, it's role as an umbrella organisation had its own issues. Plagued with minor internal struggles and being called out for harbouring fascists within its ranks, EOKA is considered by some the choice influenced by the results of the war in Europe."
 twrcyprus.9.a:0 "AKEL, for the workers!"
 twrcyprus.9.b:0 "EOKA, for land and country!"
 
 twrcyprus.10.t:0 "The Masked Massacre"
 twrcyprus.10.d:0 "Many on the island of Cyprus have long demanded integration into the Greek kingdom, the idea of union between the two nations being a long held goal of the EOKA. They are so alike, after all: Shared ethnicity, shared language, shared religion. Now, it appears as if another similarity has emerged: Shared White Terror. The island has never been occupied by the fascist powers as their brother has, but after tonight, one could easily be forgiven for assuming so. Their shared victims certainly would, after all. \n\nOn this day, military clad figures stormed the city of Nicosia in the middle of the night, covered by the cloak of darkness and hidden beneath hood and mask. Their uniforms and allegiances were identical, but their face coverings were not: Perhaps it was symbolic of what they truly represented, the nameless, faceless forces of Cypriot nationalists. Who they were was not important: They were a collective, here to enforce a vision shared by many. With the fervor of men possessed, they tore into the homes of known communists. Those who joined socialist organizations were dragged through the streets. Gunshots rang out well into the night. Over one hundred lives were snuffed out within hours, and yet, not a single officer of the law even attempted to end the slaughter. It was a targeted attack, rather than an indiscriminate campaign of violence. The victims were not random, but carefully selected and planned. By the time it was over, the result was clear: Their blood was the same color as their ideology. \n\nIt was of no comfort to what remained of the AKEL to hear that their opposition denounced the terror waged against them the next day. Listening to speeches calling for unity that simultaneously downplayed the true oppression they faced did not grant them any form of peace. News that a 'small amount' of masked assailants would likely be difficult to investigate without names or faces to go off of offered no promises of this being a lone incident. Acknowledging a 'sweeping crime wave' while quietly disposing of all evidence of the massacre did not make them feel any safer. \n\nStill, it was only the most paranoid among them who realized all too late that those masked figures were acting on orders."
 twrcyprus.10.a:0 "They do what we can not, and for that, we are grateful."
 
 twrcyprus.11.t:0 "The Eastern Mediterranean People's Federation"
 twrcyprus.11.d:0 "With the revolution slowly establishing its roots within our nation, a question has been in our minds, the question of our Greek brothers. For decades now, the demand for a union with Greece has been requested by our people and now seems like a good chance to do so.\n\nAs the revolution also spreads in Greece, we will come in contact with our Greek comrades in the KKE and propose them that our nations unite under a socialist federative state. Of course, for this to be achieved they would have to agree to our proposal but we can only wait."
 twrcyprus.11.a:0 "Brothers shouldn't be separated."
 
 twrcyprus.12.t:0 "The Cypriot Proposal"
 twrcyprus.12.d:0 "Our liberated brothers in Cyprus have approached us with an interesting proposal. As their history of Enosis has been going on for quite a long time, they have proposed that we create a new state, one similar to the USSR. one called the Eastern Mediterranean People's Federation.\n\nIf we do accept this proposal, it would begin a new era for our people but of course, it won't be without its issues and problems that we will need to address. On the other hand though, if we don't accept, we could always form a pact between our nations as to protect the revolutions in our countries no matter the enemy.\n\nThe choice now remains at the stroke of a pen."
 twrcyprus.12.a:0 "Enosis under the Workers Revolution!"
 twrcyprus.12.b:0 "Apart but united in protecting the revolution."
 
 twrcyprus.13.t:0 "The Eastern Mediterranean Defence Pact"
 twrcyprus.13.d:0 "While our proposal for Enosis may have failed, our Greek brothers proposed the formation of a defence pact as to protect each other. With complete military cooperation and protection guaranteed, the revolutions within our states are bound to survive."
 twrcyprus.13.a:0 "Not what we wanted but close."
 
 twrcyprus.14.t:0 "A Plea for Aid"
 twrcyprus.14.d:0 "A scathing report has come to our attention from the newly independent state of Cyprus. Under the EOKA government of Makarios, the Turkish Cypriots have been victims of mass oppression, politically, religiously and many more, being treated as second class citizens.The situation has become so bad that as of recent,, boats of refugees have been arriving at our coast.\n\nAs the nation of the Turks, we have to care about the international status of our people and their well-being. Thus, we must now act and protect the Turkish Cypriots or turn the blind eye as to not suffer a potential war."
 twrcyprus.14.a:0 "We must intervene!"
 twrcyprus.14.b:0 "We cannot afford tensions..."
 
 twrcyprus.15.t:0 "Turkey Issues Warning"
 twrcyprus.15.d:0 "It seems that our policy on the Turkish Cypriots has caused some issues within the Turkish government. A stern warning was made at the United Nations by the Turkish Representative, warning that if Cyprus didn't treat the Turkish Cypriots as equal citizens, Turkey would have to intervene to protect its people.\n\nNow this situation puts us in an uneasy position. While the Turks could be bluffing, they could potentially also be truthful about their warnings. Thus we must either back down and accept their demands or hold firm and hope they are bluffing."
 twrcyprus.15.a:0 "Back down, we can't afford another war."
 twrcyprus.15.b:0 "No one will again tell us how to rule our nation!"
 
 twrcyprus.16.t:0 "Cyprus' Insolence"
 twrcyprus.16.d:0 "Despite our warnings, the Cypriot government has decided to ignore us and continue on its oppression. Its time to decide our next course of action.\n\nWhile one option for us to simply push aside the item, the other comes at a grimmer result, war. For if we want to protect our people and maybe expand our influence, we invade the island and put an end to this mess."
 twrcyprus.16.a:0 "Diplomacy has failed us, lets move on."
 twrcyprus.16.b:0 "Diplomacy has failed us, prepare the troops!"
 
 twrcyprus.17.t:0 "Cyprus Calls for Help"
 twrcyprus.17.d:0 "Despite our warnings, the Cypriot government has decided to ignore us and continue on its oppression. Its time to decide our next course of action.\n\nWhile one option for us to simply push aside the item, the other comes at a grimmer result, war. For if we want to protect our people and maybe expand our influence, we invade the island and put an end to this mess."
 twrcyprus.17.a:0 "Provide Material and Staff support."
 twrcyprus.17.b:0 "They brought this on themselves!"
 
 twrcyprus.18.t:0 "Turkey Declares War"
 twrcyprus.18.d:0 "It seems the worst has come to our doorstep. We are once more asked to pick up our weapons and defend our nation! The Turkish menace has come to our doorstep and we must push it back now!"
 twrcyprus.18.a:0 "Cypriots, your country calls you again!"
 
 twrcyprus.19.t:0 "The End of a Futile Invasion"
 twrcyprus.19.d:0 "The only recently torched earth of Cyprus slowly clears up from the smoke of its burning ruins. The quiet movement of horse drawn carriages and children break the dawn as flies feast on the corpses of Greeks, Cypriots and Turks. A nation in ruins once more, a nation torn and its people slaughtered and displaced.\n\nThe war torn flag of Cyprus flies again, the last time it will be lowered. For the Cypriots have won but the Turkish Cypriots future will remain uncertain..."
 twrcyprus.19.a:0 "Victory but at what cost..."
 twrcyprus.19.b:0 "May Allah protect our people..."
 
 twrcyprus.20.t:0 "Liberation of Cyprus"
 twrcyprus.20.d:0 "Our war for the liberation of the Turkish Cypriots has been successful! Thanks to our valiant troops, we have forced the Cypriot government into submission, putting the country under the military occupation of Turkey.\n\nWith the previous government in jail awaiting their judgement by the international courts, we have three options on what to do with Cyprus. One is to keep it under our direct occupation and make use of it ourselves. Two is to place it under military administration under the leadership of Necdet Üruğ which would require for us to spend less resources on its occupation. Third is to create a republic puppet state under the leadership of Rauf Denktaş and the National Unity Party."
 twrcyprus.20.a:0 "Continue Occupation Procedures."
 twrcyprus.20.b:0 "Establish the Cypriot Military Administration."
 twrcyprus.20.c:0 "Establish the Turkish Republic of Cyprus."
 
 twrcyprus.21.t:0 "The Turko-Cypriot War"
 twrcyprus.21.d:0 "Tensions broke out between Cyprus and Turkey as the Turkish government declared war against the Cypriot government for its persecution of the Turkish Cypriots. After repeated warnings and demands, the Turkish government answered back to the ignorance of the Cypriots with the bombing of a Cypriot vessel in Northern Cyprus, declaring the beginning of the Turko-Cypriot War.\n\nWhile UN officials have called for a ceasefire, neither side has let up the fighting and both Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been displaced in the thousands."
 twrcyprus.21.a:0 "Such barbarity..."
 twrcyprus.21.b:0 "East and West will always collide."
 
 twrcyprus.22.t:0 "Cyprus Repels Turkish Invasion"
 twrcyprus.22.d:0 "Despite the efforts of the Turkish Armed Forces and Navy, the Turkish government was forced to sign a peace treaty, ending the conflict and retreated any and all forces it may have in the country.\n\nReports have stated that many Turkish Cypriots have been boarding Turkish military vessels with their children and families to avoid the persecution by the Cypriot government. Public persecution and lynchings have also been reported to have been occurring since the end of the war by Greek Cypriots, taking revenge for the war, as the government turns a blind eye."
 twrcyprus.22.a:0 "A nation united but deeply divided."
 
 twrcyprus.23.t:0 "Turkey Occupies Cyprus"
 twrcyprus.23.d:0 "Despite the efforts of the Cypriot National Guard, the Cypriot government was forced to sign a peace treaty, surrendering the island to Turkey as the government officials were arrested for crimes against humanity.\n\nReports have stated that many Greek Cypriots have been hunted down by Turkish Cypriots in acts of vengeance, with murders and lynchings happening under the nose of the Turkish military. UN officials have been calling the situation in Cyprus as "A humanitarian catastrophe.""
 twrcyprus.23.a:0 "A nation united but deeply divided."
 
 twrcyprus.24.t:0 "The Creation of the E.M.P.F."
 twrcyprus.24.d:0 "A new union state has formed in the Mediterranean under the name of the Eastern Mediterranean People's Federation as the states of Greece and Cyprus combined. \n\nLed by a united General Secretariat by both the AKEL and KKE, the new federative union has declared that it will continue to push forward with its revolutionary ideals, wishing to protect the workers of Greece and Cyprus against all threats, both Western and Fascist. The union has caused several Western embassies after a speech made by the KKE General Secretary, Charilaos Florakis saw him critiquing the West as but the founders and supporters of the kinds of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy."
 twrcyprus.24.a:0 "Another Union, Another Soviet."
 twrcyprus.24.b:0 "The communist plague is spreading..."

 twrcyprus.25.t:0 "The Cypriot People Request Enosis"
 twrcyprus.25.d:0 "A request has come to our attention from the Cypriot government. Since its early anti-colonial and independence days, the Cypriot people have been promoting the idea of Enosis, the union of Greece and Cyprus into one. The Cypriot people seeing themselves brothers to the Greeks\n\nWith them finally being their own state under the leadership of Makarios the III, they have now requested we allow them to join us. Of course while good, it could possibly cause its own issues as well, especially in the department of defence.\n\nAs such, we must be careful on our choices. We either allow them to join us or we establish a sort of defensive pact to protect each other."
 twrcyprus.25.a:0 "Enosis will be accomplished!"
 twrcyprus.25.b:0 "Defense is more of an issue right now."
 twrcyprus.26.t:0 "Greco-Cypriot Enosis"
 twrcyprus.26.d:0 "News have been pouring in from Greece as the Greek government announced its union with Cyprus under the plan of Enosis. Annexed into Greece as part of its sovereign land, Cyprus is now but a distant region of the Greek state. While many rejoiced, minor protests have been occuring in Cyprus by the Turkish Cypriots, declaring a lack of representation of their people in politics and society."
 twrcyprus.26.a:0 "Two Brothers United."
 twrcyprus.27.t:0 "The Greco-Cypriot Defense Pact"
 twrcyprus.27.d:0 "While our proposal for Enosis seems to have been declined, our Greek brothers have instead offered us the creation of a defence pact as to protect our people. It may not be what we wanted but it is what we need."
