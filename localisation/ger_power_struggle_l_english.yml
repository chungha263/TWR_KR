 gcw.7771.t:0 "Schutzstaffel Schism"
 gcw.7771.d:0 "As the war drags on, the collective trust placed on Heinrich Himmler is fading considerably. On the surface, the officers appear to be united under the SS Banner. But, rumours of a brewing plot against Himmler have appeared. While these rumours are nothing but bare-bones accusations, a threat is certainly growing within Himmler's faction."
 gcw.7771.a:0 "These are just rumours!"
 gcw.7772.t:0 "Wewelsburg Conspiracy"
 gcw.7772.d:0 "Secret investigations ordered by Himmler have revealed that the most worrying rumours are correct. The so called Wewelsburg Conspiracy reveals that a considerable amount of Schutzstaffel Inner Circle members have formed pacts and drafted plans to drag Himmler down from the position of leader. Due to the lack of information on the full list of members in this conspiracy on top of the secretcy of the investigation, Himmler can not attempt a purge to break this conspiracy until a rightful cause surfaces."
 gcw.7772.a:0 "Damnit! Guess we can only wait..."
 gcw.7773.t:0 "The Wewelsburg Conference"
 gcw.7773.d:0 "Reliable reports suggest that the members of the Wewelsburg Conspiracy are planning a meeting in the Schutzstaffel HQ within the upcoming weeks. With reliable informants reporting that they will invite Himmler himself to attend in order to discuss matters related to the current state of affairs."
 gcw.7773.a:0 "What!? A meeting?"
 gcw.7774.t:0 "An Invitation"
 gcw.7774.d:0 "A secret letter has been sent to Heinrich Himmler, inviting him to attend the Conference planned by the Wewelsburg conspirators. Loyalist advisors urges Himmler to ignore this invitation, suggesting that this might be the end of Himmler's reign as Reichsführer-SS. However, if Himmler were to attend, he might be able to resolve the schism himself and solidify his rule in times of crisis."
 gcw.7774.a:0 "Attend the meeting."
 gcw.7774.b:0 "Ignore this foolish request!"
 gcw.7775.t:0 "Wewelsburg Plot"
 gcw.7775.d:0 "A group of Schutzstaffel Officers welcomed Himmler to the meeting. However, the true intentions of this meeting were revealed when the meeting room was placed under lockdown by Schutzstaffel Soldiers loyal to the Wewelsburg Conspirators. Himmler is now forced to take part in an upcoming event that would determine his leadership's fate."
 gcw.7775.a:0 "WHAT!?"
 gcw.7776.t:0 "Himmler Arrested"
 gcw.7776.d:0 "After a heated debate, it's finally decided that Himmler will be removed from power. The former Reichsführer-SS was forced to write an official letter of resignation and will be placed under immediate house arrest. The majority of Schutzstaffel officers seem to be unfazed by this sudden event, and has pledged loyalty to the new administration."
 gcw.7776.a:0 "What is going on..."
 gcw.7777.t:0 "Himmler's Leadership Consolidated"
 gcw.7777.d:0 "The heated debate ended in a simple conclusion - Heinrich Himmler will remain as the Reichsführer-SS. While the Wewelsburg Conspirators are not punished, this false move will certainly kill any chances of a significant political career within the Himmler Regime."
 gcw.7777.a:0 "Phew..."
 gcw.7778.t:0 "Himmler Assassinated!"
 gcw.7778.d:0 "At noon, three 'Judeo Bolsheviks' dressed in Schutzstaffel uniforms bursted into Himmler's office and shot him for at least 11 times, ending his life in a swift motion. While these are the \"official\" reports on Himmler's cause of death, the real cause of Himmler's death seems to be highly suspicious.\n\nMeanwhile, the Schutzstaffel High Command hastily organised a secret funeral, one that lasted only for a few hours, followed by a brief public mourning period. Regardless, the future of the Schutzstaffel is uncertain, and political chaos ensured."
 gcw.7778.a:0 "What? A funeral? That quick!?"
 gcw.7779.t:0 "Failed Assassination Attempt"
 gcw.7779.d:0 "At noon, three Schutzstaffel Soldiers burst into Himmler's office and shot him numerous times. However, Heinrich Himmler was largely unharmed and the soldiers were caught red-handed. Through hours of questioning, it's revealed that the Wewelsburg Conspirators were behind this killing, and with this rightful reason, Himmler has announced a broad purge to remove the threats to the SS and Germany. While no recognisable high ranking officials were purged, this will serve as a warning sign for the whole SS to stay in line."
 gcw.7779.a:0 "Purge the traitors!"
 gcw.77710.t:0 "The New Reichsführer-SS"
 gcw.77710.d:0 "With the removal of Himmler, minor elements of the SS remain discontent. The leadership has largely agreed to take a stance for unity in the Schutzstaffel Faction, agreeing to pick a new Reichsführer-SS amongst the powerful figureheads."
 gcw.77710.a:0 "Lammers will be the rightful leader."
 gcw.77710.c:0 "Summon Heydrich to take the post."
 gcw.77711.t:0 "Chaotic Appointment"
 gcw.77711.d:0 "The Schutzstaffel High Command has collapsed after the death of Himmler. Many within the organization is seeking guidance from the council, hoping that a powerful figure can replace Himmler as the Reichsführer-SS and stablize the current situation at hand."
 gcw.77711.a:0 "Lammers will handle this!"
 gcw.77711.c:0 "Summon Heydrich to handle this mess."
 gcw.77712.t:0 "Reinhard Heydrich Summoned"
 gcw.77712.d:0 "Reinhard Heydrich has been summoned to lead the Schutzstaffel in Germany. Before his departure, Heydrich has appointed Alfred Frauenfeld as the Provisional Commissar of Gotenland, ordering him to resume daily operations during his absence."
 gcw.77712.a:0 "Have a safe trip, Herr Heydrich!"
 gcw.77713.t:0 "Chaotic Power Struggle"
 gcw.77713.d:0 "The group of officers who seperated from the Schutzstaffel are forming cliques and warlord organizations. With no divine leader, who will punch their way into becoming the new Reichsführer-SS?"
 gcw.77713.a:0 "Roll the dice!"
 gcw.7781.t:0 "The Manstein Question"
 gcw.7781.d:0 "Von Manstein's recent decisions have raised doubts in some parts of the General Staff. Some claim that Von Manstein has surrendered too much to the hardline Nazi fanatics, with few officers openly declaring their disapproval towards Manstein's recent actions.. While no major opposition appeared as of this moment, this is a hint of what's to come."
 gcw.7781.a:0 "Manstein is still a clean general...right?"
 gcw.7782.t:0 "Formation of the Moderate Corps"
 gcw.7782.d:0 "Headed by noteable moderates in the Wehrmacht, Hans Speidel, Hasso von Manteuffel, Johannes Blaskowitz and possibly Erwin Rommel, the informal faction known as the Moderates have been gaining traction from soldiers and officers alike in the Wehrmacht. This faction's motives are currently vague, but a sense of anti-Manstein could be reported from our informants. While alarming, it's best to take no actions as of this moment."
 gcw.7782.a:0 "It's just a gang of few generals."
 gcw.7783.t:0 "Officer Defiance"
 gcw.7783.d:0 "A noticeable number of officers are now openly refusing orders from Manstein as an act of defiance against his extremist appeasement policies. While Manstein stated to them behind closed doors that these are merely tactics to gain the hearts and minds of Bavarian citizens, the officers ignored and continued to protest."
 gcw.7783.a:0 "You fools!"
 gcw.7784.t:0 "The Iron Speech"
 gcw.7784.d:0 "An unplanned gathering of troops occured today in the Austrian countryside, where the phrase "Iron and Order" was repeated again and again. Led by Dietrich von Saucken, with some unknown orders, the troops begun unexpected maneuvres."

Feldmeijer also allowed Schutzstaffel passage within Westland, but disallowing any form of actual garrisons, in order to maintain a neutral facade during the Civil War.\n\nFor now, it seems that Westland Neutrality is to be respected, but that would only be a temporary matter, once Westland eliminates it's unloyal elements, the Schutzstaffel Gauleiters would surely join us again in fighting the two Bolshevik pretenders of Germany."

 tgcw.1.d:0 "Rudolf Hess has seen and believed many things, few of them conventional. In fact, his belief in the necessity of clearing out space in the East for the German race was how Hitler got the idea for the Generalplan Ost in the first place. But his beliefs, no matter how crazy or unrealistic or brutal, were always centred on an immutable faith in the eventual triumph of Nazism. And now the unshakeable core of his beliefs, the Thousand-Year Reich, the Pillar of the Aryan Man, is crumbling around his thin shoulders. Rudolf, ever the follower, is crumbling too.\n\nArms still trembling with the weight of his briefcase, the tired old man takes an anonymous Volkswagen with the number plate scrubbed off to his ride to Sweden, and the dubious safety of a jail cell. He knows he's doomed to the sidelines as the Reichstag's biggest and brightest tear themselves apart, and he lost hope in his own advice years ago when the Fuhrer tossed him into Munich with a brusque instruction to stay out of politics. For Hess (and he is himself aware of this) the only winning move he can make is not to play. \n\nAnd so he takes off, promising a possible return to the few of his supporters still devoted enough to see him off. The guns crackling behind him prove that a probable lie. Rudolf Hess is an ideologue and a believer, but above all things he is a survivor - and he is more than aware that he will not live very long in any version of Germany that has no time for his theatrics, which at the moment is most of them. Even the Resistance Movement is reluctant to acknowledge his existence - for Hess, the road from follower to exile to leader will be hard indeed, if it exists at all."

The Defence Minister exclaims that allowing Hess to stay might spark a diplomatic incident with the German government, with the Swedish Royal Air Force is ready at a minute's notice.\n\nWe can choose to allow Hess to land, or send our squadrons to take him down before he has the chance to set foot on Swedish soils."

But since the rise of Martin Bormann, Rudolf Hess was put on the sideline, granted a powerless title and forced into a life of forced semi-retirement. However, the outbreak of German Civil War created fear within the Honorary Deputy's mind, which gave him the incentives of fleeing Germany.\n\nOn a secret flight, Rudolf Hess escaped Germany with a flight across the Baltic, carrying with him pricey possessions into Sweden, safely landing after his flight was granted permission to enter Swedish airspace. Upon landing, Hess requested an audience with the monarch, which was rightfully ignored."

These rumours were dubbed as the "Germanic Game", these stories are leaking into the public consciousness. Right after the funeral, the Committee has fell back into infighting, and it's becoming more and more apparent that unity is nothing but a forgotten buzzword, used by the Committee to shame political enemies and ensure each's influence within the Government.\n\nWhile none in the public dares to mention the on-going struggle, it is clear that everyone is plotting, plotting to gain the post of Chancellor for themselves."

A secret meeting between the Big Five showed the clearly fabricated Last Will, Himmler is threatening the Committee to create what he wants - the SS Ordenstaat Burgundy, with Himmler be the head and an independent Schutzstaffel Armed Forces, with little to no interference from Germania, effectively turning Burgudny into his own Fiefdom. On the other hand, Himmler assures the Big Five that if his demands aren't met, he will gladly take the whole of Germany with his Schutzstaffel and rightful title of Appointed Successor."

He assured the rest of the Committee that if they are willing to support his rightful claim to Chancellorship, they will get appropriate and generous treatment. While, he mentioned the Schutzstaffel are now in position to storm Germania in a minute's notice."

 twrgersw.17041.d:0 "With Himmler threatening the Committee, the Heer has hinted neutrality until further actions are taken by the Schutzstaffel. Meanwhile, a heated debate that lasted for hours is happening in the Committee, with two factions forming. One side argues that by allowing Himmler's fabricated or factual will, this can prevent Germany to fall into complete chaos with the lost will, and one side claiming the Last Will presented by Himmler is obviously fake.\n\nThe Committee has once again fall into chaos, and Heinrich Himmler might be getting impatient."

Goebbels also claimed that Himmler has prepared Schutzstaffel troops on the outskirts of Germania, and they are ready to slaughter the city's population. \n\nThe people were furious, they believed everything that Goebbels claimed."

 twrgersw.17043.d:0 "After the speech made by Goebbels, militia units were formed, declaring their loyalty to the one true successor - Joseph Goebbels. And on one evening, Goebbelite Elements of the Army alongside the Goebbels' Militia stormed Schutzstaffel outposts and occupied Germania. With the Heer refusing to support the Transitional Government, Loyalists were outnumbered and the Committee was declared defunct and over by Joseph Goebbels. Majority of the members within the Committee were left unharmed, with the exception of Heinrich Himmler, whose whereabouts are currently unknown."

 twrgersw.170441.d:0 "When Goebbels launched an attempt coup against the Schutzstaffel and Committee, the Heer intervened and entered into a brief street combat with Goebbelites in Germania. Volkshalle changed hands for several times, the combat was intense but it was clear that the Government has the upper hand. After hours of fighting, the last pockets of resistance were crushed by the Heer, and the coup was declared a failure. However, due to Joseph Goebbels' popularity amongst the German people, Goebbels was not charged with any crimes, but instead forced into retirment away from the political scene."

Vultures don't smile, not even at each other. Their eyes are on the prey, on the prize, and the beaks are twitching in that crowded courtroom. Blood is in the air.\n\nSpeer, Himmler, Bormann: they give the opening speeches to the trial, because who else would? They're the maestros for this little performance, and every word breathed will go according to the plan they've laid out. Such is the measure of their hate for the man that they've collaborated on this, setting aside their considerable distaste for each other. Vultures can peck at the same corpse, even if they hate their fellows.\n\nThe proceedings begin, and the expected denunciations ring with just the right timbre: treason. Conspiracy against the state. Violence against officials. Shock, horror, even one or two notes of muted grief; sorrow over the self-destruction of a servant of the Führer. The judge nearly rips his robes in shock. Oh yes, the notes ring just right - and Göring is shushed every time he tries to interrupt the symphony. It will set a record even by the considerable standards of the German Reich's legislative proceedings: 437 orders to quieten the accused in just 180 minutes.\n\nEven at this late hour the Reich has mercy for its condemned: enough of his supporters staff the jury that the eventual verdict is only one of permanent house arrest, not execution. For the Reich is experienced in torture, and knows the cruelty of its mercies. Execution makes a martyr. But a man slowly withering away in his room will live, and die, a tool of the State he betrayed."

 germanps.991.t:0 "Göring In Power"
 germanps.991.d:0 "Through trickery and his iron will, Hermann Göring has secured his place as Germany's leader, casting Martin Bormann aside. The most favoured candidate has won the first phase of the power struggle, but will Göring be able to maintain his leverage?"

 germanps.10.t:0 "Speer-Goebbels Bloc"
 germanps.10.d:0 "Shortly after the formation of the Senate, Albert Speer and Joseph Goebbels have formed a form of voting bloc in an attempt to dominate the Senate. Speer and Goebbels also visited and appeared before the public together. This pair of partners seem to have already secured most of the public's support in such a short amount of time. Some in the Senate are now beginning to feel worried about these developing threats."
 germanps.10.a:0 "This is worrying."
 germanps.11.t:0 "Bormann's Condemnations"
 germanps.11.d:0 "Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, addressing the Senate during a meeting, spoke about 'harming elements' that are hidden within the Senate and these people are jeopardizing Germany's unity. Obviously, these speeches were directed at Speer and Goebbels' recent actions, while both of the pair were present.\n\nWhen Bormann's speech was concluded, half of the room started clapping while both Speer and Goebbels' Bloc sat silently.\n\nThe facade of unity within the Senate has shattered."
 germanps.11.a:0 "Oh dear..."
 germanps.12.t:0 "Reichsführer-SS and Senate"
 germanps.12.d:0 "Facing the seemingly unstoppable power of the Speer-Goebbels Bloc, Martin Bormann has approached Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, suggesting that the Schutzstaffel should take a more active role in Senate matters, a move that could allow Bormann to secure power and keep the Senate officials in line.\n\nIn exchange, Bormann also promised Himmler a prominent role on German politics and a high position within the future Bormann Government.\n\nHow did Himmler respond?"
 germanps.12.a:0 "Accept but The SS should have greater influence!"
 germanps.12.b:0 "Himmler and Bormann forms a secret bloc!"
 germanps.12.c:0 "Himmler refuses the offer, but SS will keeps watch."
 germanps.13.t:0 "The Wehrmacht Betrayal"
 germanps.13.d:0 "After the news about Himmler's deal with Martin Bormann was leaked, the Wehrmacht leadership felt betrayed.\n\nThey chose to side with the Senate, but now the government that the Wehrmacht swore their loyalty to have sided with their biggest opposition - The Schutzstaffel. Wehrmacht inner circles have secretly retracted their oath and are now deciding on a new path for the army to take. Some argue that the Wehrmacht has to take matters into its own hand, while others believe that this is the best chance to strike a secret deal to support Speer and Goebbels.\n\nNo matter what decisions they may make, this is certainly a great blunder for the Senate."

 germanps.13.c:0 "Only Göring is trustworthy!"
 germanps.14.t:0 "Speer-Goebbels Bloc Storms Out!"
 germanps.14.d:0 "The Senate meeting after Bormann's dealings with Himmler resulted in the Schutzstaffel holding greater influence in politics.\n\nHowever, words have been leaked and Senate officials are now aware of these underhanded negotiations. While most at first held doubts, the presence of a large group of armed SS officers in the Senate Hall confirmed the theory.\n\nMembers of the Speer-Goebbels Bloc debated aggressively, saying that Bormann's decisions were illegal and were not approved by the majority of Senate. During these heated debates, Bormann continued to deny any and all accusations time and time again, repeatedly shutting down any related discussions. Frustrated by such behaviour, Joseph Goebbels and Albert Speer stormed out of the hall. While they were first stopped by the SS Guards, Martin Bormann issued the order to let them pass. Many Senate members followed Speer and Goebbels, leaving the Senate half empty by the end of the day's session."

 germanps.15.d:0 "With tension growing in Germany, Joseph Goebbels is still actively making grand speeches to the public. But, some have noticed slight changes in the latest speeches held by Goebbels. Citizens noted a significant presence of 'Militiamen' around the speech location.\n\nThese men bore striking resemblance to the Sturmabteilung back in their peak during the German Republic's paramilitary chaos.\n\nThis might be a first sign of a restarting of public political violence for Germany."
 germanps.15.a:0 "Brownshirts? Again?"
 germanps.16.t:0 "Senate Discontented"
 germanps.16.d:0 "With Bormann's secret dealings performed behind the Senate's back, discontentment is now growing within the chamber. More have joined the Speer-Goebbels faction and are now challenging Martin Bormann."

 germanps.17.b:0 "Appease the Senate!"
 germanps.19.t:0 "Bormann Ousted"
 germanps.19.d:0 "Bormann's unchanging position has proven to be the Senate's last straw. He has lost all support within the party and has been forcefully removed from the Party and the Senate. They have decided to hold an emergency election as soon as possible."
 germanps.19.a:0 "Over with Bormann!"
 germanps.20.t:0 "Calming the Senate"
 germanps.20.d:0 "The Senate might be appeased for now, but they seem to think that the best solution for Germany now is to hold an internal election for a bew leader as soon as possible. How should Bormann respond?"

 germanps.21.t:0 "SS Betrays Bormann"
 germanps.21.d:0 "Bormann thought he could control the Schutzstaffel, but in reality, the SS simply used him as a stepping stone.\n\nRemoving both him and the Senate at the same time under the pretext of 'National Security', the Schutzstaffel successfully overthrew the Senate and Bormann, making Heinrich Himmler the new leader of Germany."

 germanps.23.d:0 "Martin Bormann thought he could call in the Army to help him secure total control over Germany, but he was in the dark when the Wehrmacht plotted to overthrow both him and the Senate.\n\nWithin a day, many officials and Bormann loyalists were placed under arrest in a coordinated military coup. A Military Junta has been formed and a status of 'National Emergency' has been declared."
 germanps.23.a:0 "Iron will!"

 germanps.24.d:0 "Wehrmacht Soldiers following the directives of Bormann have successfully dissolved the Senate and arrested its members under the pretext of 'Containment'.\n\nOvernight, they have put Bormann in the position of national leader.

 germanps.24.a:0 "Heil Bormann!"
 germanps.25.t:0 "Vote of No Confidence"
 germanps.25.d:0 "With Bormann accepting their demands, some Senate officials are now calling for a Vote of No Confidence, demanding a replacement to serve as the upcoming national leader.\n\nThe election was supposed to come, but Bormann didn't expect it to go this way."
 germanps.25.a:0 "Bormann believes in himself. He will win the vote."

 germanps.25.c:0 "That's it! Abolish the Senate!"
 germanps.26.t:0 "Bormann Removed!"
 germanps.26.d:0 "The results of the vote were announced - Martin Bormann was finally removed once and for all.\n\nAll that's left for the Senate is to pick a new leader for the Reich, with opposing factions struggling to come out on top."

 germanps.27.a:0 "Heil Bormann!"
 germanps.28.t:0 "Bormann Coup"
 germanps.28.d:0 "Overnight, Martin Bormann has declared an end to the senate. However, this move might give the opposition factions a great opportunity to move to depose him. If another faction's influence grows too great for Bormann's control, Himmler might use Bormann's forceful abolition of Senate as the justification to launch a counter coup."
 germanps.28.a:0 "Bormann is the leader...for now."

 germanps.30.d:0 "With Bormann out of the picture, Albert Speer and Joseph Goebbels have finally stepped up and become the leaders of Germany.

 germanps.31.t:0 "Military Rule"
 germanps.31.d:0 "With the government seemingly in chaos, the Wehrmacht has been summoned to ensure law and order. Units stormed the Senate hall and dismissed all officials before making a statement, confirming that a Junta headed by Erich von Manstein has been established."
 germanps.31.a:0 "Glory to the Army!"
 germanps.32.t:0 "The Security Coup"
 germanps.32.d:0 "The decision to invite SS as a backup for Senate has proven to be a colossal mistake. Heinrich Himmler, alongside his loyal SS Members, stormed and secured the Senate hall.\n\nDeclaring himself as the new official leader, the party officials have no choice but to allow these actions. With this, Himmler has successfully gained power over the country."
 germanps.32.a:0 "Heil Himmler!"
 germanps.33.t:0 "Unternehmen Walkure"
 germanps.33.d:0 "Speer and Goebbels knew Himmler couldn't be trusted, so they have came up with a plan to disarm Himmler's faction peacefully and cripple the chances of a hostile SS uprising against the new German Government. However, advisors have suggested that this plan is highly risky and will certainly result in a rebellion. Nonetheless, Speer and Goebbels are determined to make a gamble rather than sit idly in the dust."
 germanps.33.a:0 "Storm the SS Headquarters!"
 germanps.34.t:0 "Schutzstaffel Purged"
 germanps.34.d:0 "Suprisingly, the large-scale rebellion that was expected to happen never came. A few gunshots were exchanged in close quarters but the operation was executed successfully across the country.\n\nAll loyal elements of Waffen-SS and SS higher ups have been sidelined, including Heinrich Himmler himself. Both organizations have been greatly weakened and will never be able to influence politics again."
 germanps.34.a:0 "What a victory!"
 germanps.36.t:0 "Schutzstaffel Resists!"
 germanps.36.d:0 "As expected, the Schutzstaffel didn't take our actions kindly and have risen up in open rebellion against the Government. Fighting has broken out on the streets of Germania surrounding the SS Headquarters and some districts have declared their support for the SS cause. The once united German Volk have been divided into two."
 germanps.36.a:0 "We will bring order and justice to the Rebellious Cultists!"
 germanps.37.t:0 "Dealing with Himmler"
 germanps.37.d:0 "Heinrich Himmler is a significant figure in the power struggle and the safest way to secure control is to gain his support. This might be achieved if we choose to grant a large chunk of land for Himmler and his mad, cultish SS to become their private playground in exchange for political support. While most would accept such a fair deal, Himmler is most certainly an unpredictable person..."
 germanps.37.a:0 "Grant him Burgundy!"
 germanps.37.b:0 "He will get his Burgundy."
 germanps.38.t:0 "Himmler in Burgundy"
 germanps.38.d:0 "Seeing the massive benefits, Heinrich Himmler gladly accepted his new personal fiefdom in exchange for staying out of the power struggles in Germania.\n\nWhile this might be considered a small deal by some, Himmler has also transfered Germany's Waffen-SS Units to Burgundy's personal domain. A price for peace and stability, was this worth it?"
 germanps.38.a:0 "Enjoy, mad man."
 germanps.38.b:0 "For Burgundy!"
 germanps.39.t:0 "Himmler's True Intentions"
 germanps.39.d:0 "Even with our generous offer, Himmler has refused our offers. His intentions are clear - he wanted all of it.\n\nIt is evident that Himmler might raise his banner to claim the title of Fuhrer for himself. The only question is how many would join his cause?"
 germanps.39.a:0 "Prepare!"
 germanps.40.t:0 "Dismantling the SS"
 germanps.40.d:0 "From the moment Germany under the leadership of Hitler and the NSDAP rose from the ashes into glory, it's clear that the Wehrmacht and Schutzstaffel have always been at odds with each other. Now, with a military government in power, the SS is growing restless.\n\nTo ensure the longevity of the Military Junta, the total disarmament of the Waffen-SS and weakening of the SS is our only option. There's no place for both of these factions to coexist."
 germanps.40.a:0 "Stability at all cost!"
 germanps.41.t:0 "Disarming the Wehrmacht"
 germanps.41.d:0 "While the Wehrmacht is the main army of German Reich, it was Hitler's original plan to replace the main fighting force with the Waffen-SS, and with the hostility between the Schutzstaffel and the Wehrmacht, this might be the perfect excuse for us to disarm and dismantle unloyal elements of the Wehrmacht once and for all. We will make sure that they learn their place under the SS, and that the regular army has no place in politics."
 germanps.41.a:0 "Waffen-SS will accomplish their goal!"
 germanps.42.t:0 "Wehrmacht Crippled"
 germanps.42.d:0 "We expected a fight, but it turns out the mighty German Army might be a myth afterall. With few shots and minimal losts on our side, the Waffen-SS have successfully captured Wehrmacht Plotters and Officials. The Schutzstaffel have showed the Wehrmacht what their true role is, and with no effective leadership, the Wehrmacht has been wiped from the face of German Power Struggle in one fell swoop."
 germanps.42.a:0 "Good..."
 germanps.43.t:0 "Wehrmacht Resists!"
 germanps.43.d:0 "With the Waffen-SS arriving at major military HQs, barracks and positions across the country, they were met with machine gun fire and forced to retreat in many locations. It seems that, after the Wehrmacht caught wind of the plots against them, they have drafted a plot against the German Government. An emergency Military Junta has been set up, and a large chunk of Germany's regular military has answered the Junta's call against the SS. Germany has been divided."
 germanps.43.a:0 "Those damned 'Prussian' General Staffs!"
 germanps.44.t:0 "Fufilling the SS"
 germanps.44.d:0 "As part of the plan for consolidating control, Martin Bormann shall now target the Military instead of the Schutzstaffel. With the Crystal Purges occuring, current events provide the perfect excuse to pull out all of the Wehrmacht's teeth to make sure they know their place in the new Germany, and to reinforce the tradition of the military not intervening in politics."
 germanps.44.a:0 "Waffen-SS! Round them up!"
 germanps.45.t:0 "Fufulling the Heer"
 germanps.45.d:0 "With Martin Bormann trying to win over the Army, the military has insisted that if Bormann wants the Wehrmacht's full loyalty, he must crush the Schutzstaffel and grant the military a pass on most affairs. This means weakening the Schutzstaffel and disarming the majority of the Waffen-SS.\n\nA coup against the Government might be highly likely with such unacceptable demands, but to secure vital political support, Bormann has no choice but to follow through."
 germanps.45.a:0 "Hunt those SS Down!"
 germanps.46.t:0 "Dividing and Conquering"
 germanps.46.d:0 "The Speer-Goebbels Bloc is dangerous to Hermann Göring's leadership, and those two must be stopped at all cost. Joseph Goebbels had a decent relationship with Hermann Göring, which means the tactic of dividing might be best suited to destroy this contender. By offering Goebbels an esteemed position within the Government, the trust between Speer and Goebbels could be broken, rendering the Bloc powerless without joint leadership.\n\nOr, Hermann Göring can choose to send core members of the bloc to remote diplomatic missions, effectively eliminating Speer and Goebbels' supporter base."
 germanps.46.a:0 "Invite Goebbels to join us!"
 germanps.46.b:0 "Crack their power base."
 germanps.500.t:0 "Germania Confusion"
 germanps.500.d:0 "While everything at first seemed normal, a huge firefight suddenly broke out outside of the Reichstag. Reports were unclear on who or what caused the firefight, and police first responders to the scene were fired upon. This firefight, first started off with two sides turned into a Free-for-all, friendly fire was common as the chaos spread from the Reichstag to the streets of Germania.\n\nReports claimed that members of the Waffen-SS and Wehrmacht soldiers were present and attacked one another, with all sides wearing similar uniforms."

 germanps.501.t:0 "Old Guard's Coup"
 germanps.501.d:0 "During all the political chaos, Speer-Goebbels-Goering launched a coup in the name of safeguarding the Nation, successfully ousting the ruling body from Germania. However, this gesture has been seen as an act of open hostility, and both the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel have refused to acknowledge this Government. This new Government by Speer, Goebbels and Goering now have temporary control, but it's only a matter of time before Germany crumbles into the dust."
 germanps.501.a:0 "Goebbels will be the temporary leader."

Germany needs a guiding hand, and I have come to guide Germany as the Führer intended. I promise to every proud German that I, Albert Speer, will finish the task that are left by our dear Führer. Together as one, we will make the Führer proud!

Stated that; \"The Führer left us too soon. And my goal as the new leader is to avenge the Führer! Whoever dared to make such outrageous plot will be punished! And it's our duty to be united, against the common enemies of the Greater German Reich!\"\n\nThis speech triggered giant reactions within the German public, everyone eager to find out the true reason of the Führer's death."

 germanps.510.d:0 "Martin Bormann has been in the dark for most of the German public, now that he has emerged as the leader of Germany, people expected him to address the public with a speech. However, they were instructed to listen to the scripted speech. And when the public tuned in, they were greeted by Martin Bormann's aide - Gerhard Klopfer. It seems that Gerhard Klopfer has been ordered to speak on Martin Bormann's behalf. In the script reading, Klopfer expressed Martin Bormann's goal of becoming the leader, and bringing stability to Germany, but did not mention anything about the Führer or any s griefing.\n\nThis speech has been described as the oddest speech in the Reich's history."

 germanps.508.d:0 "Arthur Seyss-Inquart, an unlikely candinate at first that sybverted all expectations, he had to show everyone that he was worthy of the job. The speech and address that Seyss-Inquart made towards the German people served to shape the image of a strong leader within Seyss-Inquart. Parades were held and the speech was guarded by legions and legions of German soldiers.

Heinrich Himmler spoke about German purity and all matters of the Reich, saying how anyone might be the person responsible in the plot to kill the Führer, and how nobody could be trusted besides the righteous Schutzstaffel.

In front of millions of witnesses, Hermann Göring described the former government as \"decadent and grossly incompetent.\", exclaiming that he has been able to form a compromise between all of the potential factions, saving the Reich from utter destruction.\n\nWhile his words might be exaggerated, it seems that tensions are cooling in Germany. Vocal oppositions against the establishment has died down and the transistion can finally begin."

Satisfied by such acts of appeasement, Himmler has promised stay out of the power struggle as long as his insanity could be fufiled in this kingdom of his."

A peaceful gathering, held by German Citizens in Prague, called for all sides of the Civil War to unite as one and settle their differences for the greater good of Germany. The gathering turned into a march, as ever more bystanders joined. The march turned into a protest, demanding the Governments of Germany end the civil war and reform. The Bohemian Government has declared a state of emergency, with all security forces not already involved elsewhere being summoned, and they are waiting for the signal..."

gcw.4.d:0 "The State of Emergency in Bohemia has backfired - people in Prague and across Bohemia held true to their beliefs that the Civil War must be stopped and the oppressive regime be overthrown, and little did the Local Officials know, the Czechs have reached their breaking point. Just minutes before dawn, a local Military Police patrol was ambushed by a band of resistance fighters in Prague and suffered annihilation. Like clockwork, resistance cells around the city have armed themselves and risen up with blood and iron. Chanting in both Czech and German, many in Bohemia are now united with a common goal of ending the suffering, with one last wave of bloodshed."

Groups of anti-Nazi activists formed by disgruntled Germans are growing in confidence all across the Reich, and with the Nazi Government finding the crack-downs to be harder and harder, the so-called "German United Front", a collective of several resistance groups, have organised into a massive anti-war and anti-nazi movement centred in Germania. When local Police Forces were summoned to the protests as first responders, they were given permission to open fire. However, they refused to follow orders and the Government was forced to relocate a brigade of militia guards to handle the situation instead. \n\nWith the militia in position, they are ready for the signal ... Under gunpont, the rebels are standing firm."

gcw.6.d:0 "Like every other uprising before, it started off with a brief peaceful period, but with bad decisions and the Nazi Government inevitably deciding to stamp down brutally on the dissenters, the revolution has been sparked. The Nazi brainwashing machine crafted by Goebbels has failed in times of hardships as neighbourhoods fell one by one across the city of Germania. A majority of the locals successfully forced the government to relocate and have secured weapons from military police depots, and after a few days, the German United Front proclaimed the People's Germany, with their capital located in the now Rebel controlled Germania. \n\nWith the heart of Nazi Pride controlled by anti-Nazi German revolutionaries, it is clear the Civil War has reached its climax, and the fate of Germany must be decided sooner or later."

After a decade of German occupation, Moscow is now back in Slavic hands, but the end of the Reichskommissariat will certainly not be the end of chaos within the Muscovy Region.\n\nWith two factions greatly at odds with each other, the White Movement and Communists will undoubtedly turn against each other after the depature of Germanic tyrants from their motherland. While these locals have achieved the goal of becoming free, the biggest beneficiary from Moskowien's downfall is the Soviet Union.
