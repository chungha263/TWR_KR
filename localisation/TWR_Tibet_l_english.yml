    twrtibet.2.t:0 "Humming of the Engines"
    twrtibet.2.d:0 "When the Himalayan Republic introduced its air force it had proven everything the higher ups had hoped; organised, disciplined and ready to go at a moment's notice. Unlike many in Asia the Himalayan nations can boast a proficient if inexperienced aerial military, and the winding mountain passes and plateaus below them can be safely guarded by a firm ground army, and the expenses of such a feat are compensated both by aid and access to manufacturing from their Indian Allies. \n\nDespite this ideal situation there are still a few rumblings of displeasure. The general public continues to chafe under a united government which is somehow Bhutanese, Tibetan and Nepali, whilst being none of them at once. Though this confusion has been mostly relegated to the country's few insular intellectuals there have been similar discontents within aspects of the military. \n\nAmidst this muted chaos the Himilayan Air Force has been experiencing what many see as growing pains. Reconnaissance missions and routine border patrols have been taking longer and longer, and breaks to refuel have begun to drag on. On top of this many pilots have begun talking amongst themselves and conversations seem to stop suddenly when army grunts reach the canteens or officers check up during those prolonged fuel breaks. \n\nWhatever is going on with the new air corps the high command seems cautious to act. Some whisper of plots or foreign interference. Despite it all the Air Marshals seem to have it under control and have remained strictly professional in handling whatever situations rear their head. \n\nShould all go well this elite cadre of pilots will make the Himalayas a fortress for socialism in Asia just as the mountains served as a bulwark against warlords and marauders. The young country has faith in its armed forces and whatever problems or plans there might be, for now all is calm with the humming of the engines overhead."
    twrtibet.2.a:0 "The protectors of our skies!"
    twrtibet.3.t:0 "Stockpile Shortage"
    twrtibet.3.d:0 "Fears of corruption pick up as a few planes and a few guns have vanished from remote stockpiles in the Himalayas. Rumors of a general having sold it for his own gain, possibly even to the Chinese, have begun to stir trouble. \n\nA formal investigation has been launched, with the Air Force taking particular care in aiding the investigation."
    twrtibet.3.a:0 "That equipment wasnt easy to get..."
    twrtibet.4.t:0 "An Unorthodox Proposal"
    twrtibet.4.d:0 "As the army continues to stir in the uncomfortable chaos that comes with forging a multi-ethnic and multi-national military, a handful of leading figures within the Air Force have submitted a proposal to be approved by the Council of Ministers. A truly odd and exceptional concept, they request the right to form a political group for the purpose of instilling revolutionary ideals into the military beginning with the relatively small aviation corps and potentially spreading to other branches of the armed forces. If successful, they argue, the current frustration and discontent could be soothed through internationalist ideals and socialist unity. \n\nWhilst similar to smaller campaigns currently underway some have raised eyebrows. This new \"Red Wings Organisation\" would be relatively independent of the ruling parties and several ministers fear this may set a precedent. Others seem content, however, and believe it may ensure the socialist spirit of the Republic is instilled properly in both soldiers and civilians."
    twrtibet.4.a:0 "We gotta instill the values of socialism in our military some way."
    twrtibet.5.t:0 "The Capital Bombing"
    twrtibet.5.d:0 "The view from Potala Palace was stunning as always. Room to room people moved and bustled, fighting the hoard of paperwork which at the moment seemed to be the greatest enemy of the people. When Phuntsok Wangyal, proud communist and glorified clerk, stared idly at the city of Lhasa through the window between bouts of stamping and signing he imagined what role he could play in raising his country up from a collection of mountain valleys to a pillar of the world revolution. As the day came to close and the sun began to set past the mountaintops he allowed himself a moment of respite before leaving his station. There was a light bustle from his office and the city below, the sigh of the breeze and a song in the wind. The chirp of birds was soon joined with the soft hum of engines overhead as the planes made their routine patrols. \n\nThe buzz of aircraft soon doubled. Then tripled. By the time what sounded like a fourth plane had joined the others one of the other workers in the office went to look out the window. A roar jolted them back against a desk as one of the aircraft dove too close for comfort before pulling up and around. A commotion stirred in the office and, before Phuntsok could even think to be scared, thunder seemed to strike the roof and the ceiling came crashing down on him. \n\nOne plane landed in the palace courtyard to deliver demands. A young pilot serving as representative of the self-proclaimed 'Red Wings Party', seemingly a conspiratorial core of the Himalayan Air Force, delivered demands for the immediate handover of power from the current government to a committee of Air Marshals. Flashes and explosions could be seen in the city and the outskirts of the palace as local garrisons try and fail to fight back against their airborne opponents. \n\nA handful of secretaries shamble from Potala Palace, now with two large holes blown into it. Neither the Dalai Lama nor the core Ministers are amongst them as the chamber they were occupying was amongst the targets of the bombers. Soon the leading Marshals make their way into the courtyard and have the civil servants who now technically run the country sign over themselves and their state at gunpoint to a conspiracy who's plans and motives for now seem unknown. \n\nThe future is uncertain for the Himalayas. By the time news reaches Delhi a new military government has already been established in Lhasa. All that can be truly known now is that those who oppose this new state will learn to fear the skies above."
    twrtibet.5.a:0 "Glory to the Red Pilots!"
    twrtibet.100.t:0 "Coup in the Himalayan Republic"
    twrtibet.100.d:0 "Since yesterday all communications with the Himalayan Council were cut until today when we received a report of a coup overthrowing the council. According to our reports, the whole of the Himalayan Council was bombed the Himalayan Airforce before the remainder of the council of ministers surrendered the government to the Red Wings Party officers. While Himalaya may no longer be under our control, we don't really see any point in trying to reestablih our order over them as they still act as a buffer state between us and China."
    twrtibet.100.a:0 "A minor loss."

    #Descriptions
    Himalayan_Council_Desc:0 "Established in co-operation with the Indian government, the Himalayan Council acts as the primary organ of power for the Himalayan Republic. Comprised of representatives from all cultures and people of the Himalayan Republic, the Council is considered by many as a revolutionary form of government, similar to the Soviets of the Soviet Union. Among its members are figures such as the 14th Dalai Lama, Pushpa Lal Shrestha and many others. While under close co-operation with India, many use caution when meeting with the Council, with many fearing the strings being operated by the Indian government."
    Red_Wings_Desc:0 "The Himalayan Airforce Commissariat was formed primarily by Marshals of the Himalayan Air Force who under the umbrella of the Red Wings Party launched a coup against the pro-Indian Himalayan government. Soon joined by anti-Indian and militaristic members of government who survived the bombing of Potala Palace, as well as a few defecting generals, the Commissariat was formed to fill the void left by the previous Council of Ministers albeit far smaller and extremely isolationist. It is the hope of the HAC that the Himalayan Republic can be reforged as a socialist state on the model of Stalin's USSR with a focus on autarky and socialist patriotism."
    Tenzin_Gyatso_DESC:0 "Born Lhamo Thondup, the 14th Dalai Lama represents a new era of Tibetan politics. Traditionally believed to be the reincarnation of the previous Dalai Lama, the current Dalai Lama is marked by his youthfulness and intellect."
