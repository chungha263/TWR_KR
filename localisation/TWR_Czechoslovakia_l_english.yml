twrczechia.1.t:0 "Czech Ceasefire"
twrczechia.1.d:0 "In a miracle, our revolution was capable of keeping the Germans at bay. We have successfully defended our homeland, and as the Germans have exhausted their resources in the area, a temporary ceasefire has been signed, allowing the Czech people a brief window of independence during this time of chaos."
twrczechia.1.a:0 "We did it!"

twrczechia.2.t:0 "Ceasefire in Bohemia"
twrczechia.2.d:0 "Miraculously, the German forces in former Bohemia and the Czech resistance fighters have reached a ceasefire agreement, as the Germans are now preoccupied with more urgent issues elsewhere in Germany.\n\nAccording to the agreement, German forces will now temporarily withdraw from Bohemia, but this treaty does not signify acknowledgement of Czech sovereignty by the German factions. Regardless, the Czech people can now enjoy a period of peace."
twrczechia.2.a:0 "Truth prevails!"
twrczechia.2.b:0 "A Czech rebirth..."
