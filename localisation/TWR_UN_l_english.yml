First outlined in the 1943 Sydney Declaration, it would eventually be founded and based in New York City, with its first meetings held in 1945. With most nations in a Nazi-dominated Europe notably absent, Germania explicitly refusing to acknowledge the authority of any international organisation, it nonetheless has member-states across much of the globe, including the initial Permanent Security Council members of the United States, United Kingdom, Republic of China and Dominion of Canada.§!"
