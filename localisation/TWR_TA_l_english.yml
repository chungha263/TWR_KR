    twrta.7.d:0 "Though some parties supported immediate intervention, others were opposed, and a general agreement could not be met, and the meeting has ended without the Council deciding to intervene immediately.

    twrta.8.d:0 "With direct intervention in Germany having been rejected by the Toronto Accord's members for the time being, British officials have come up with a smaller proposal for an intervention of sorts, using old plans from the war of 1939-1940. Sweden was a vital source of iron for Germany, needed for its economy and war effort, and a plan was devised to invade Norway preemtively and cut off the supply. This was foiled with Germany's own invasion of Norway, but with the Nazi state now having collapsed into civil war, they are unable to hold onto their Norwegian puppet state. The old plan, known as Plan R 4, could be revived, updated, and put into action, providing allied forces with a northern base with which to perform further operations as well as cutting off Germany's iron ore supply. \n\nAmerican backing is seen as being needed for this operation, shall we propose it to the United States?"

    twrta.15.d:0 "Following reports of the shooting down of a US spy plane over German territory, the US air force has launched widespread retaliatory strikes across Germany, hitting military and industrial targets held by all of the civil war factions. It is clear that the Americans are spoiling for war. While we could retaliate unilaterally, launching our available missiles and aircraft against Toronto Accord military assets in Britain and the North Sea, doing so would virtually ensure all-out war, and a full-scale intervention of the Toronto Accord. How should we proceed?"
