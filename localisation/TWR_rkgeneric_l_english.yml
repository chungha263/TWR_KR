Despite being the minority within Ostland, the Baltic Germans control the majority of the economy."
 
 RK_eastern_spring:0 "Eastern Spring"
 RK_eastern_spring_desc:0 "'Hitler is dead.' These three words were enough to inspire the oppressed people of Eastern Europe.

 UIA_german_support:0 "German Aid"
 UIA_german_support_desc:0 "Siding with the Germans has its benefits. The Germans have been kind enough to send us capable equipment to combat the traitors of Ukraine if we agree to maintain the grain shipment to the Germans.

 RUK_focus_on_food_export_desc:0 "Ukraine is the wheat machine of Europe. Our role in this world is to produce wheat, and then export them to the ones that need them the most - the Germans.\n\nThe wheat must flow, no matter what the cost might be."

 RUK_active_resistance:0 "Active Resistance"
 RUK_active_resistance_desc:0 "The local insurgency is very much alive and active in Ukraine.

 ROS_land_of_opportunity_desc:0 "Ostland has attracted more settlers than any of the other eastern colonies, with families coming from all over the Reich to homestead the frontier.

 ROS_agrarian_society_desc:0 "With the German policies towards colonisation, Ostland has been populated by Agrarian German settlers, dotted around different parts of Ostland.

 ROS_failing_economy_desc:0 "The Reich is doing poorly so were doing poorly aswell, we can't do a lot with a failing economy."
 ROS_ethnic_tensions:0 "Ethnic Tensions"
 ROS_ethnic_tensions_desc:0 "Even since before the German-Soviet War, the German settlers of Ostland and Ukraine have found themselves in conflict with the native Balts and Slavs. Since the creation of the Reichskommissariats, these conflicts have only become worse, with partisans continuing to terrorise the German settlers, bomb houses, and operate from the shadows. In turn, the Reichskommissariat governments and the Einsatzgruppen have continued harsh anti-partisan measures, to limited success."

 ROS_dorpat_shale_oil_joint_stock_company_desc:0 "The Dorpat Shale Oil Company was founded after the Reich seized and nationalised the Estonian Viru Chemistry Group Company that operated in the Dorpat area, with its mines, power plants and refineries being rebranded and reused to power the Reich's war machine.

 twrostland.0.t:0 "Ostland - The Shining Frontier"
 twrostland.0.d:0 "Reichskommissariat Ostland, the German colony that consists of Belarus and the Baltic States - One of the most stable, fastest growing Reichskommissariat in Eastern Europe. Under the guidance of Hinrich Lohse, Reichskommissariat Ostland has been experiencing surprising growth. Ostland's role as the transport hub for German goods to enter the other Reichskommissariats have also been proved as one of the most important factor on Ostland's esteemed position as a Kommissariate.\n\nMeanwhile, Germanization efforts in Ostland are steady, with a more neutral relationship between the Germans and the Balts. In fact, majority of Ostland's law enforcements are made up of Estonian, Latvian and Belarusian Volunteers, making Ostland a type of strange, German culture melting pot, a strange phenomenon that might not last with future policy changes."
 twrostland.0.a:0 "Ah, Ostland."

 twrostland.1.t:0 "Civil Unrest?"
 twrostland.1.d:0 "Unfortunately, yet predictably, our plans to deport the Slavs and Balts have failed to come to fruition. As the word spread, violent unrest among the non-Germanic population has followed in its wake. Violence has spread among the cities, and reports of increased partisan activity have reached the government. The worst troublemakers have been dealt with, but we must remain alert for potential escalation of native unrest."
 twrostland.1.a:0 "Concerning."

 twrostland.2.t:0 "Ostland Requests We Pass Their Plans"
 twrostland.2.d:0 "Ostland asks us to accept their plans of using different tactics to start germanizing the baltic region. The plan is more costly but it should keep them with more manpower to use in the factories and army."
 twrostland.2.a:0 "Ja!"
 twrostland.2.b:0 "Nein!"

 twrostland.9.b:0 "Implementation of a half a year import of food."
 twrostland.9.c:0 "Let them suffer!"

 twrostlandcw.1.t:0 "Baltic Revolution"
 twrostlandcw.1.d:0 "News of Germany's downfall reached the Baltic States. Despite our best efforts to suppress information, this information has triggered a chain reaction, awakening partisan organisations to finally launch actions against the Reichskommissariat. Our security forces failed to control the Baltic Partisans, and Ostland is finally doomed by Germany's downfall."
 twrostlandcw.1.a:0 "For the Baltic Confederation!"
 twrostlandcw.1.b:0 "Für Deutschland!"

 twrostlandcw.2.t:0 "Ostland Civil War"
 twrostlandcw.2.d:0 "Reichskommissariat Ostland, despite being the most stable Reichskommissariat, could not stand against the tide of revolution after the German Reich's failure. On the Baltic coast, a Baltic Rebellion rages on, forcing the German authorities to face Baltic's combined might. In the Eastern Frontier, A Soviet style Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic rose up against the Ostland Government, launching a surprise attack against local garrisons.\n\nWithout German aid, Ostland is expected to fall within the upcoming months, with the future of this region filled with uncertainties."
 twrostlandcw.2.a:0 "Another Civil War!"

 twrostlandcw.3.t:0 "Belarusian Collapse"
 twrostlandcw.3.d:0 "The Baltic Awakening has crippled our ability to enforce order, Belarusians viewed this as the perfect opportunity to overthrow the German Government. The Belarusian Partisans, believed to be secretly supplied by the Soviets have managed to capitulate the White Ruthenia Regional Government without a fight, transferring large amount of control to the Partisans before the Reichskommissariat could act.\n\nThe second uprising has arrived, and Ostland's fate might be sealed once and for all."
 twrostlandcw.3.a:0 "Long live Belarus!"
 twrostlandcw.3.b:0 "Ostland Forever!"

 twrostlandcw.4.t:0 "Victory in Ostland"
 twrostlandcw.4.d:0 "With the formal surrender of the German garrison and those members of the garrison's high command who haven't fled being placed in custody celebrations have erupted across what was once known as Ostland, from Tallinn to Minsk old Nazi iconography is gathered up and burnt and effegies of the old Reichskommisar are regularly hung. Those German soldiers unfortunate enough to be captured by partisans are carted out onto the streets in chains and are pelted by debris from the cities they tried so hard to hold onto. The situation is perhaps even worse for the German settlers, the fortunate among them have been placed on trains leading back to Germany, the unfortunate being left to the enraged populace.\n\nRiga castle. Once the focal point of hatred and fear throughout the entirety of the Baltics, the fortress from which Lohse and his brutes would command their instruments of tyranny, where emblems and banners dedicated to the single most destructive force in all of Europe once flew has now been redecorated in the red and white of the Baltic resistance. Photos of both Baltic and Belarusian flags being waved over the gates of the castle by resistance fighters have already circulated across Europe and have found themselves in many a front page.\n\nWith the former ‘jewel' in the German crown being removed from their grasp the future of the Baltic people seems bright, out of all of the Eastern territories the Germans once enslaved the Baltics have been the least ravaged, a fact that both the Baltic council as well as the Belarusian Soviet as efforts to repair the broken region have already begun."
 twrostlandcw.4.a:0 "Long live the free!"

 twrostlandcw.410.t:0 "Collapse of Ostland"
 twrostlandcw.410.d:0 "Shocking news has emerged out of the Baltics as the region once known as the ‘jewel' in Germany's colonial empire has fallen to native resistance movements and the German garrison has either surrendered or have been forced to engage in the same methods of partisan fighting as those they despised once did. Initial reports coming out of the Baltic region suggested that the uprisings were localised to urban areas and many international observers believed that the garrison would be quite capable of crushing this minor insurrection yet just like many things about the rapidly collapsing German empire this has been proven incorrect.\n\nWhile many observers believe that the stark ideological differences between the two emergent nations will lead to conflict, a joint statement from the Baltic Council and from general secretary Panteleimon Ponomarenko has praised the brotherhood felt between the two emergent nations and it seems likely that the Baltic people will be able to build their future in peace."

twrrkauprisings.777.d:0 "The news about Hitler's death have spreaded throughout the population. While attacks are common, this specific one was larger than any previous ones, a well coordinated attack that caught most Security Forces off guard, and while packages of TNT blew up and damaged entire blocks of insutrial complexs.\n\nWe have sent our reports to the RSHA, and the attacks are confirmed to be linked with a nationalist group."

twrrkauprisings.778.d:0 "Seemingly inspired by the terror attacks, small scale workers strikes occured. While the first waves were easily suppressed, it slowly turned into a region-wide workers strike. From Baku to the borders of Moskau, oil workers stood in defiance against our rule, demanding things such as self determination and better working conditions, greatly damaging the already fragile stability."
twrrkauprisings.778.a:0 "Send in the Security Forces!"
twrrkauprisings.1.t:0 "Cossacks Revolt!"
twrrkauprisings.1.d:0 "Our supposedly 'allies' have backstabbed Reichskommissariat government after the recent events regarding unrest, reports suggest that the Cossack leaderships were behind the oil strikes and terror attacks all along! The Reichskommissar has sent requests to Germania for backup, but have yet to receive any response as of this moment."

twrrkauprisings.2.d:0 "The Mountain Republic is a frankenstein republic formed by a multiethnic union. This area has always been seen as 'loyal' during the German occupation, but now, once the Germans have started to lose grip, they have showed their true intentions - to backstab the Germany when no other benefits could be provided."

The German Expeditionary Forces and Baku Security Forces have been summoned and shall be under the Exclave's Command from now on."\n\nOur ministers have stated that this is merely a convoluted way of saying Reichskommissariat Kaukasus is on her own."

twrrkauprisings.1002.d:0 "The Volga-Manych Red Army were mere remnants of Soviet troops, fighting as guerillas to restore the might of the Soviet Union on our land, but unlike their Caucasian bretheren, they do not support the idea of Cossack lifestyle and cavalry warfare at all. The aforementioned remnants have decided to start a full-blown revolt on the territory of their activity, however, they are a force which is less dangerous and more moderate than the 'Death Cossacks' of Kuban."

twrkukraine.1.t:0 "Rumours of a Plot"
twrkukraine.1.d:0 "Informants planted by Erich Koch throughout the Reichskommissariat have issued an alarming report to the high command.\n\nIn details, the report hints that the chance of an inner party attempt to remove Erich Koch from the position of Reichskommissar is imminent, and that the Koch's ministers are disloyal and unsatisfied of Koch's dictatorial manners.\n\nThe pieces that held Reichskommissariat Ukraine together are now crumbling, and if Koch doesn't act quick, the entire Kommissariate might collapse with a gentle shake, from inside or outside."
twrkukraine.1.a:0 "Oh no..."
twrkukraine.2.t:0 "Planning The Congress"
twrkukraine.2.d:0 "As a last ditch effort to save his own powerbase, Erich Koch decided to organize the Kiew Congress, a grand meeting with the goal of resolving internal divisions and determining future Ukrainian policies.\n\nWhile this might appear to be the first step of reformation in Ukraine, knowing Erich Koch's character, this congress will most likely be a tool to make himself appear more legitimate as a leader."
twrkukraine.2.a:0 "This should help the Reichskommissariat..."
twrkukraine.4.t:0 "Kiew Congress"
twrkukraine.4.d:0 "After a brief planning period and invitations, members of the government ranging from District Governors, Inspectors, to Colonial Managers were invited to attend the grand Kiew Congress. This congress has three main agendas - Colonial policies, economic policies, and the Slavic Question.\n\nErich Koch welcomed all the participants in an opening ceremony, in which he said - "The Reichskommissariat Ukraine has been operating for years since it's establishment. And today, it's finally the time for us to improve our plans, to serve Germany and her people better than what we have done in the past. Let the Kiew Congress begin!""
twrkukraine.4.a:0 "Start the Congress!"
twrkukraine.5.t:0 "Kiew Congress - Colonial"
twrkukraine.5.d:0 "The colonial efforts on Ukraine has been scattered into multiple small colonies around Ukraine. Some believe that in order to support these colonies, supplies and trade should be increased to these colonies, as a move to bolster Ukraine's lacking colonial interest. However, these ideas are certainly inefficient in the eyes of the Hardliners, led by Erich Koch. \n\nWhat should the Reichskommissariat do for the Germanic colonies?"
twrkukraine.5.a:0 "Do nothing."
twrkukraine.5.b:0 "Improve their trading network."
twrkukraine.6.t:0 "Kiew Congress - Economics"
twrkukraine.6.d:0 "Throughout the years, Ukraine's farmlands have been worked on by Slavic serfs. While these people are cheap and wildly accessible, this issue has sparked the discussion for the future of Ukraine. One group suggests, in the true sense of Germanization, the government's end goal should be replacing their Slavic workforce with a pure Germanic one. In the grand scope of economics, this is the worst goal that a Reichskommissariat should aim for, due to the Slavs being the best source of labour in the entirety of Eastern Europe.\n\nAlthough, using a pure Germanic workforce would greatly decrease Slavic influence within the society, making the Reichskommissariat much more stable."

twrkukraine.7.t:0 "Kiew Congress - Slavic Problem"
twrkukraine.7.d:0 "The Slavic population of Ukraine is still relatively high comparing to Ostland and Gotenland. For years, our policies on Slavs have been that of total suppression and full Germanic control. But in this meeting, there are now voices advocating for the use of 'Slavs of Slavs' policy. They argue that, by using loyal Ukrainians as a tool to control other Ukrainians on a local level might greatly increase the Reichskommissariat's grip over it's population. While this idea is not really an invention, Erich Koch's personality has disallowed this practice to be used in full effect, but with enough support, perhaps he has to give into it afterall."
twrkukraine.7.a:0 "Keep the current system, forever."
twrkukraine.7.b:0 "Divide and Conquer!"
twrkukraine.8.t:0 "Talks of a Successor"
twrkukraine.8.d:0 "While not part of the agenda, some in the Congress have brought up the topic of Erich Koch's successor. They suggest that, due to uncertainties, Erich Koch should always have a designated successor to prevent a system collapse upon his depature.\n\nUpon hearing this, Erich Koch was outraged, but after considering the potential pressure onto him within the Congress, he chose to..."

twrkukraine.9.t:0 "Appointing a Successor"

twrkukraine.9.b:0 "Globke, the Reformist."
twrkukraine.10.t:0 "End of the Kiew Congress"
twrkukraine.10.d:0 "After days of discussion, the Kiew Congress has finally come to an end.\n\nWhile policies might have been unchanged and the agreements after this Congress might appear to be useless, it accomplished it's task of allowing Erich Koch to sit in his Kommissariate throne safely, for now.\n\nBut did this really ensured Erich Koch's legitimacy as a Kommissar? Well, only time can tell."
twrkukraine.10.a:0 "Hmm..."
twrkukraine.11.t:0 "An Offer of Retirement"
twrkukraine.11.d:0 "Unexpectedly, a group of ministers and Reich officials have offered Erich Koch the golden opportunity of an early retirement. They say that the Reich has declared no confidence on Koch's administration capabilities, but due to his contribution to the Reich, they are now offering Koch a chance to gracefully step down from the position of Kommissar, they promised Koch immense amount of wealth, and safety from the 'upcoming crisis'.\n\nThey also warned Koch that, a catastrophic crisis is creeping it's way towards Ukraine, and this is the one and only chance for him to save his own skin before it's too late."
twrkukraine.11.a:0 "Koch is not stepping down!"
twrkukraine.11.b:0 "Koch retires..."
twrkukraine.12.t:0 "Meeting with the OUN"
twrkukraine.12.d:0 "The OUN has always been the major political group of Ukraine. While they are allowed to operate, under Koch's administration, communication between the Government and OUN never really occured. A large majority of the resistance movements are also funded by the OUN, but with Koch out of the picture, the new Kommissar has decided to meet with a powerful figurehead - Andriy Melnyk, on the issues of Ukraine. The Reichskommissar cited statements from Alfred Rosenberg, stating that an independent Ukraine is certainly a future possibility, but German guidance is crucial for Ukrainian stability.\n\nMelnyk seems to be convinced, and agreed to make an attempt in restraining Resistance activity, in exchange for less government intervention in certain parts of Ukraine"

twrukraineuprisings.1.t:0 "The Grain Crisis"
twrukraineuprisings.1.d:0 "After the Death of Hitler, the new leadership enforced even harsher grain quotas on Ukraine than ever before - it seems that they are trying to make an illusion of security and stability back in Metropolitan Germany. Both Ukrainian natives and even German settlers the Reichskommissariat are getting less and less rations, while the Reichskommissar of Ukraine has reassured Germans in Ukraine that they will get the best treatment and the current shortages are only temporary. \n\nMeanwhile, the Reichskommissariat Government has requested that the grain quota should be lowered slightly to relieve the pressure."

twrukraineuprisings.2.t:0 "German Advisors Enforce the Quota"
twrukraineuprisings.2.d:0 "Upon our request, the party official sent by Germania to inspect Ukraine has demanded that the grain quota be strictly followed. The colonial government of Reichskommissariat Ukraine, now with the writing on the wall, has no choice but to produce all the grain that it can, pushing the Ukrainian people into even harder work and even worse conditions, while trying to please the German elites."
