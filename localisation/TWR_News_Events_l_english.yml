twrnews.2.t:0 "Congo Rebellion Crushed"
#twrnews.2.d:0 "Ever since the Belgian government fled to their colony in the Congo following the Nazi invasion of the Low Countries, the stability of the Belgian Congo has been very inconsistent. While revolutionary movements had existed for a long time, a full-scale rebellion in the east of the colony had begun a few months ago, seizing large amounts of territory across the vast territories of the Congo. Now, however, with Belgian authorities back in full control with backing from their British allies, the movement has been pushed back underground and the rebellion is considered over. However, as long as Belgium's harsh colonial rule continues, troubles are sure to persist."
twrnews.2.d:0 "The Belgian Congo Colony had always been in a semi-unruly state. When the Nazis invaded the Low Countries, the Belgian Government was forced to withdraw to its last posession in Africa. Ever since then, harsh minority rule has led to increasing tensions within the region, which had culminated in open rebellion led by long-standing revolutionary groups in the east of the colony. Despite some initial successes during the early months, full Belgian authority to the Congo has now finally been restored, thanks to extensive support from allied British forces. However, though the rebellion was subdued, revolutionary organisations still persist underground, and with the continuing Belgian minority rule, their support is growing from day to day."

twrnews.3.t:0 "\"Anti-Bolshevik Air War\""
#twrnews.3.d:0 "In an act that shocked the world, Germany has launched a 'War' against the remnants of the Soviet Union. Due to the instability of the Reichskommissariats and possibly a weak supply lines for a ground offensive, however, the German government announced that they will rely solely on air raids and bombing runs to bring the remaining Soviet survivors to their knees. The reaction of this sudden war has been shock and fear across the region, while reports say that some Germans are doubtful of the usefulness of this war. However, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels claims that the German people decided on this war to finally crush the enemies of the German people once and for all, and will be united behind it."
twrnews.3.d:0 "In an act that shocked the world, Germany has launched a new 'War' against the remnants of the Soviet Union. The German government has declared that the \"rotten Bolshevik cockroaches\" will finally be brought to their heels with an extensive aerial campaign consisting of constant air raids and non-stop bombing runs. Curiously, the official government statement mentioned no conventional invasion by means of land forces, presumably due to the dire state of disorder in the eastern Reichskommissariats, hampering any attempts at effectively transporting and supplying large combat forces.\n\nWhile many in the soon to be bombed region have been stunned by fear and shock from the sudden declaration, some observers from the reich have offered tacit criticism in regards to the sensibility and usefulness of the campaign.""

It's unknown why the war was launched, and serious doubts were raised about if the war even had a chance of achieving anything of value."
twrnews.4.d:0 "The Air War has finally come to a close after many souls on both sides were lost. German officials have proclaimed an end to all aerial operations from now on until future notice, and the Soviets proclaimed a \"Victory\" against the Nazi flying machines. Mounting operational costs and a lack of any noteworthy gains outside of the addition of new craters to the Russian expanses, in addition to mounting criticism in regards to the lack of operational effectiveness have brought on an end to the pointless conflict."

#twrnews.7.d:0 "Strangely, Czechs and Germans in Prague have seemingly united, tired of the chaos and instability in Germany. What started off as a peaceful protest very quickly turned violent after a harsh crackdown from local forces. The German Officials in Prague ordered troops to open fire, while rebels smuggled in weapons to arm the protestors. The latest reports detail that Prague has seemingly fallen firmly into rebel hands, but they also suggest that this revolt will likely be ended swiftly by coming German reinforcements."
twrnews.7.d:0 "What started off as a peaceful protest very quickly turned violent after a harsh crackdown from the local garrison. The German Officials ordered troops to open fire on the protestors, while rebels smuggled in weapons to arm the protestors. Surprisingly, it seems that both Germans and Czechs were found at the side of the rebels, seemingly both tired of the chaos and instability in Germany.\n\nThe latest reports indicate that the Bohemian capital has fallen entirely into rebel hands, though German reinforcements have already been spotted en route to the city. Only time will tell if the rebels can hold their position."

#twrnews.8.d:0 "Germania's U-Bahn network has been a hotbed of fighting since the outbreak of German Civil War. Forces from all sides were unable to fully take control underground due to the sheer size and complexity of the tunnel networks, creating a strange situation where a metro war is constantly happening underground almost entirely separate to the events above ground. However, just recently, the Leftist and Democratic rebels in the U-Bahn have formed a United Front, calling for people's rule and the end of all wars and violent, Nazi rule. Arming themselves with smuggled weapons, they successfully launched a surprise attack from underground and captured large chunks of Germania, while the Volkshalle's situation remains unknown."
twrnews.8.d:0 "Germania's U-Bahn network has been a hotbed of fighting since the outbreak of the German Civil War. Until recently, none of the factions have been able to take full control over the underground, as the sheer size and complexity of the tunnel network limited any comprehensive large-scale operation. This had resulted in an odd situation where faction control underground could deviate wildly from faction control on the surface. However, just recently, Leftist and Pro-Democratic rebels sheltered in the U-Bahn have formed a United Front, calling for people's rule and the end of all wars and violent Nazi oppression. Having armed themselves with smuggled weapons, they successfully launched a surprise attack from the underground and captured large areas of Germania. Throughout all of this turmoil, the state of the Volkshalle remains unknown."

twrnews.9.d:0 "Reports from Bratislava show that a coup has occured. The fascist Tiso regime has been ousted and replaced with a Citizen-Military Government, proclaiming themselves to be the Second Slovak Republic. Reports indicate no German forces were garrisoned in Slovakia during the coup, since all the garrisons were redirected to fight in the Civil War. While this new government will most likely be crushed, for now they enjoy the taste of freedom that many Slovaks have long hoped for."

The Slovakian National Council has issued an order that all Slovaks must take part in the defense of the nation against the Hungarian invaders, while volunteers are rushing to the aid of their Fatherland, attempting to defend Slovakia from the materially and numerically superior Hungarian forces."

Titled as the Slave State by outsiders, the oppressed Russian people have finally built up the courage to rise up after catching wind of the death of Hitler. While some might argue that the rebellion was bound to happen, the revolt was certainly emboldened by the Hitler's recent death and the instability it has caused in the German government. \n\nNow, with the revolution in full swing, is this the sign for what's to come?"

twrnews.14.d:0 "Today, the British Government announced that the United Kingdom achieved what only the United States and, more recently, Nazi Germany had accomplished - the development and testing of an atomic bomb.\n\nWith tensions already high between the two powers across the channel, the development of Britain's own nuclear capabilities is only likely to increase the chance of war reerupting in western Europe. In Britain, it is being hailed as a great achievement, and a sign of Britain's determination and ability to defend itself from any German aggression. The German government itself has not released any statement, but it's likely that this is worrying news in Germania."

twrnews.15.d:0 "Switzerland's backup plan that was set in place for a post Nazi occupation has finally been activated. The secret army that hid in the Alps have emerged, under the leadership of Henri Guisan, seeking to restore the Swiss Confederation under its old democratic values. Guisan has declared himself as the Provisional Chief of Switzerland, declaring his full loyalty to the Swiss Government in Exile. Several overseas Swiss organisations have raised funds, attempting to smuggle support into Switzerland with the help of dissidents in Germany, France and Italy."

twrnews.17.t:0 "Start of the Benelux Revolution"
twrnews.17.d:0 "Reports detailing a Belgian Uprising reached agencies all around the world. While the revolt might seem to be yet another ethnic revolt in Germany, there are details suggesting that this is merely a start of a chain reaction, a starting point for a general revolution across the Low Countries. Experts suggest that a similar Dutch Uprising or perhaps a Luxembourger Uprising might occur within days. With Germany in such chaos, oversea exiled Dutch and Belgians are forming volunteer brigades and are planning to join the rebellion."

twrnews.16.t:0 "Germany Tests an Atomic Bomb"
twrnews.16.d:0 "Just hours ago, the government of Germany announced the success of its first ever atomic bomb test. The test was performed in the remote arctic region of Reichskommissariat Moskowien on February 19, and the relatively low yield weapon successfully detonated.\n\nGermania now claims that it has proven that it can match the Toronto Accord in terms of nuclear capabilities. However, military experts in the West have suggested that the announcement around the test is a bluff, and Germany does not have the full capabilities to produce atomic bombs on an industrial scale, unlike the United States. Nonetheless, a clear demonstration of theoretical nuclear capability from Germany is something that west had long feared, and now is a reality."

twrnews.18.t:0 "Labour Wins UK Elections"
twrnews.18.d:0 "Prime Minister Clement Attlee certainly made a gamble in calling a general election, and it appears to have paid off. The Labour Party have successfully won back their majority, and Clement Attlee has met with the Queen to be asked to form a new government. \nHowever, uncertainty still surrounds the longtime Labour leader, and a renewed mandate is not going to make them disappear. The party has continued division over issues such as economic and foreign affairs; it is left to Mr. Attlee to unite the party and prevent it falling into disrepute. Can this new Attlee ministry survive the test of history? Only time shall tell."
twrnews.18.a:0 "Interesting."

twrnews.19.t:0 "Conservatives Win UK Elections"
twrnews.19.d:0 "Prime Minister Clement Attlee has been voted out of office, and has met the Queen earlier today where offered his resignation. His only advice to Her Majesty was to send for the Opposition Leader, Mr. Butler, to form a new government. The new Prime Minister was always optimistic of his party's chances at this election and it seems he has good foresight. Now Mr. Butler will set out forming the first solely Conservative government since before the armistice with Germany. \nNow Mr. Butler is in Downing Street, promising to create a "strong and free" Britain as pledged in his party's manifesto. The new Prime Minister emphasised the need for change in an increasingly vague and dangerous political climate, whether such change can be achieved only remains to be seen."
twrnews.19.a:0 "Interesting."

twrnews.20.t:0 "Union Movement Wins Elections"
twrnews.20.d:0 "A man once ostracised from the forefront of politics, Sir Oswald Mosley has perhaps made the greatest political comeback in history. Mosley met the Queen earlier today where he was asked to form a government. Upon entering Downing Street, Mosley formed the first Union Movement government in British history. Watching these events unfold, it is hard to believe the political journey of such a man. The first British premier since Lloyd George to be neither Labour or Conservative.\nNow the task falls on him to bring the nation together, in an ever increasing period of uncertainty. Winning by one of the slimmest margins in history, even now as the government has been formed there are disputes over the overall national vote. Nonetheless, this election will perhaps go down as the most dramatic in British history."
twrnews.20.a:0 "Interesting."

twrnews.21.t:0 "No Clear Winner in UK"
twrnews.21.d:0 "One of the most dramatic general elections for a generation is over, and has resulted in no party achieving overall control of the House of Commons. The Prime Minister made a gamble in calling the general election, and it appears to have backfired. Instead of winning back Labour's majority, Mr. Attlee has lost even more seats. \nIn the next few weeks, Labour may be forced to make an alliance with minor parties such as the Liberals. Butler's Conservatives could even be the one forming the next government with other parties. Mosley's small but growing Union Movement may make things much more difficult.\nAttlee's position may now be viewed as untenable after this disaster for his increasingly factional party. Now we must ask, is the British public ready for yet another coalition government?"
twrnews.21.a:0 "Interesting."

twrnews.22.t:0 "Rhee Resigns"
twrnews.22.d:0 "The protests that had been steadily building steam had reached a peak, and seeing his power over the nation and army deteriorating, President Syngman Rhee was forced to resign, and is believed to have left the country. \nThough he ruled under the pretense of an American-style liberal democracy, his relatively short-lived regime was characterised by authoritarianism and suppression of political and civil rights. With the great president now gone and the sudden power vacuum it has created, there are hopes from some of a true parliamentary democratic system, while others a pushing to drive the country in a more radical direction. \nIt remains to be seen what will happen next."

twrnews.23.d:0 "Although many thought the gathering protests against Rhee's regime would bring change, with the army choosing to stick by the old 'President', the massed crowds were forcibly dispersed, even with gunfire in places, leaving dozens dead. Its leaders are being hunted down and arrested, and any hope of government change in the near future has been shattered. \nA further crackdown on already erode rights and even a 'purge' is likely to come for Syngman Rhee to cement his previously shaky rule, which for the time being seems to be here to stay."

A national government has been proclaimed by the Indonesians, rejecting to acknowledge Dutch authority over the East Indies.\n\nThis revolution is the result of systemic inequality within this supposedly \"Confederation\", to the point where one man that isn't even in Indonesia can spark such a large-scale national revolution."

The Government of the Netherlands has agreed to a withdrawal from Indonesia, but the peace settlement allows the Netherlands to keep their control over Dutch New Guinea for the time being. While the Indonesian government is in favour of this peace deal, this settlement is unlikely to be permanent on its own, and will require a later full resolution."

twrnews.29.d:0 "With the conflict between the Dutch and Indonesians settled, Indonesia has successfully achieved nationhood. Millions celebrated, but they also cried out for the release of Sukarno from illegal captivity. The Government of the Netherlands has been forced to recognise Indonesia's status as a nation and expressed their respect towards Indonesian national boundaries.

Its personnel and other members have been evacuated to the Dutch colony of Suriname, declaring an end to the Confederational Status between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The remaining areas of Dutch control in Indonesia are now under the direct control of the Dutch Colonial Army, and widespread panic in these areas are reported, as White Dutch settlers in these areas scramble to board refugee ships bounded for Australia and Singapore.

germannews.1.d:0 "After rumors from Germany of the formation of an International SS Corps, Germania has finally released an official statement regarding this issue. The SS has announced its willingness to accept volunteers from all around the world that are following National Socialist ideals and will swear allegiance to the New Order. Countries such as United Kingdom and United States of America have already issued a statement ordering their citizens not to become a cog within the German War Machine. Meanwhile, sympathetic organisations within Middle East and Asia are already reportedly planning to form volunteer groups for German SS."

germannews.2.t:0 "The Führer is Dead!"
germannews.2.d:0 "Today, the most powerful man in the world, and the man who has defined the last 30 years of history, the Führer Adolf Hitler, has perished. This month was a turbulent month for Hitler, suffering 2 strokes and having multiple heart attacks, thought to be the culmination of years of medical issues. Leaked reports indicate he was eventually left weak and mostly unable to walk, staying in his private home, the Berghof, to rest and stay close to his wife, along with one of the best doctors in the Reich in the case of emergency. The area around the Berghof has locked down from any civilians.\nThe German government has announced a period of national mourning for all of Germany for one month, while millions of others across the world will briefly celebrate the death of the man who brought so much suffering in his wake."

germannews.4.t:0 "Manned German Spaceflight"
germannews.4.d:0 "Reports from German state news and information from surrounding radar stations have proven that Germany has successfully launched a manned, suborbital spacecraft to an altitude of around 138 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The pilot was Heini Dittmar, who was confirmed dead during the craft's reentry. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels announced this as a major victory for the Aryan people, and declared Dittmar a martyr of the German Volk. This sudden move has shocked the western world, and while this showed that the Germans have the ability to reach space, it is considered unlikely that the struggling Nazi state could spare the resources to mass-weaponise space technology."

germannews.501.d:0 "The internal situation of the Greater German Reich has now been in a downward spiral, and with the first major open rebellions coinciding with instability within metropolitan Germany itself, Germany's central government seems to have temporarily evacuated many of its forces from the Directly Controlled Regions of the Caucasus, handing control of them to the Kaukasus colonial Government. One by one, various factions in the Caucasus region have declared their open resistance against the German government. Reports indicate the Reichskommissariat Kaukasus administration requested additional support from Germania, but, too preoccupied to spend resources on suppressing this far-off rebellion, they have been sent only a small "Expeditionary Force" to support the Kaukasus Government."

With rebels on all sides, the Reichskommissariat is surrounded by enemies, whom are eagered to fight the Germans after the years of oppression. The Soviet Union has benefited from the unrest in Ukraine, successfully enabled the Southwest Red Army to be formed and battle-ready.\n\nWhile the rebels are largely underequipped, the pure determination in their ranks might serve as their best weapons during this fight to the death."

germannews.503.t:0 "Formation of a Ukrainian Government"
germannews.503.d:0 "Due to the ineffectiveness of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine's direct colonial Government, Germania has withdrawn Reichskommissariat Ministers and replaced them with a puppet Government filled with Ukrainian collaborators. However, even with the change of official leadership from a German to Ukrainian government, not much has really changed - Germany still holds absolute control of the Ukrainian food industry and Ukrainians are still seen as low-class citizens in their own nation, though the new government is strongly loyal to Germany and proclaimed that Ukraine will be Germany's ally till the end of time.\nThe Ukrainian Insurgent Army shows no intention on ending hostility even with the formation of a Ukrainian collaborator government."

germannews.505.d:0 "Poland was the Reich's first conquest through blood and fire, and correspondingly it was a shock to the Germans and the international community when a loose coalition of resistance groups was able to overthrow the local German administration of the 'General Gouvernement'. But recent reports coming from the Eastern European country indicate that the Southern Liberation Front, the loose alliance between the Poles and the Liviv Liberation Army has broken down. Citing irreconcilable differences between the two, leaders from both sides have issued orders to their respective organisations to begin hostilities against the other.\nAfter a brief liberation, this ancient land is again cast into violence and war."

However, with their common enemy defeated, reports have begun to filter in about fighting between Communist and Nationalist forces. It was unlikely that nationalist leaders would sit down at the negotiation table with the Soviet military council, but international onlookers hoped for at least a moment of respite in the newly liberated territory. While both sides accuse the other of starting the hostilities, the fact of the matter is that a civil war in Ukraine is inevitable at this point."

Russian reactionaries, communists, and anarchists have all claimed parts of land of the former Reichskommissariat Moskowien and it seems as though the absence of a common enemy has revealed the conflicts within the Russian liberation movement. Although it is impossible to predict which element will win out at this moment, it seems as though the people of western Russia are in for yet another round of conflict and suffering."

Speculation on why the SS High Command rushed to erase memories of this major incident and engaged in massive downplaying are running rampant around the world.\n\nWhile the official reports released to the public detail that the Reichsführer-SS was assassinated by \"Judeo Bolsheviks\", the nature of his death and inconsistencies in the official story have created conspiracy theories on this issue. Regardless, the SS is now in a state of crisis, and if they wish to maintain stability, the organisation must internally pick a new replacement as soon as possible."

Students and workers' rights advocates clashed with police officers, police stations were raided and the two sides had major firefights in many urban regions. In a state of panic, the Government ordered the police to open fire on the protesters. These orders were carried out and shots were fired, with hundreds of protesters and students wounded or killed. The riots have been quelled for the moment, but major condemnation from internal and external opposition is already forthcoming. \n\nThe Japanese Government made it clear that it believes these actions were necessary to prevent a Leftist Takeover."

As riot police and protesters clashed, the Japanese Government, seemingly seeing that the situation was getting out of hand, decided to order the police to use lethal force against the students. These orders were ignored by several regiments, and in some cases, officers defected to the protesters, strengthening the rebels' firepower. Later that day, protesters alongside the militia forces formed by radical students managed to seize the apparatus of state and overthrow the Japanese Government. \n\nThe Foregin Garrisons in Japan are unharmed in their bases, but the young post-war government has been dragged from power."

He was reported missing from his estate just days ago, and while the German government seemingly paid little attention to this, having far more pressing concerns, recent information about an unidentified aircraft violating Swedish airspace, triggering the Swedish air defence system, has been linked with his disappearance. The pilot of this plane has been discovered to be Rudolf Hess himself, largely unharmed, and currently recovering in a hospital in southern Sweden. Rumors suggest that Rudolf Hess might seek status as a refugee until Germany is stable once again."
