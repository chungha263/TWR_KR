croathungary.1.d:0 "Small rebellions flared up all over Vojvodina suddenly by Croats living in the area. Armed with pitchforks, axes and muskets from the previous century, Croats demanded Vojvodina be ceded to Croatia, to their "rightful homeland". While they were making such demands, they also destroyed major parts of the railway to the area, slowing down the movement of our troops to the region to suppress their rebellion. \n\nSomething isnt right about this suddent rebellion..."

croathungary.3.t:0 "Loss of Vojvodina"
croathungary.3.d:0 "The damned Croats managed and defeated us in Vojvodina, making our troops retreat in the mainland. As the Croatian flag flies over Vojvodina, our flag is stepped on in shame by the Croatian soldiers."
croathungary.3.a:0 "We will be back Croats!"
croathungary.4.t:0 "Treaty of Pecs"
croathungary.4.d:0 "No matter what we did, the Croats defeated us in the war, forcing upon this embarassing treaty where we have to cede Vojvodina and Prekmurje to them. Upon us forcibly signing the treaty, the Croatian generals begun to insult us as they left the building. \n\nThis is a shameful moment for Hungary..."
croathungary.4.a:0 "We will be back Croats!"
croathungary.5.t:0 "Treaty of Zagreb"
croathungary.5.d:0 "Our valiant men brought honour to their homeland once more by beating down those despicable Croats in their own lands! With an unsteady and unwilling hand, the Croats signed the Treaty of Pecs, announcing their defeat and ceding to us Novi Sad. This is a victorious day for Hungary and another normal day for Croatia. \n\nCroats, a people stubborn enough to fight even when they have lost from the start!"
croathungary.5.a:0 "Dicsőség Magyarországnak!"

twrhungary.0.t:0 "The Stagnate Years"
twrhungary.0.d:0 "Since the Kingdom's emergence as a victor, the nation has grown more dependent on the profits of Germany.\n\nWhile this period brought Hungary great benefits, German trade influence also meant a sharp increase of German political control over Hungary. Several institutions were established to represent German interest in the region.\n\nFor the longest time, the Horthy Government has tolerated the existence of these groups. However, the German economic collapse of 1948 convinced the Regency that it is now time to make an important decision, in order to transform Hungary into a nation that could withstand the test of time."
twrhungary.0.a:0 "Regnum Mariae Patrona Hungariae!"

twrhungary.1.t:0 "3rd German Rally Organized"
twrhungary.1.d:0 "The Volksbund has created a sort of tradition. Every year since its formation, the Volksbund continued to organize annual rallies near Budapest.\n\nThese rallies often attract thousands of German supporters, and while the Horthy Regime is eagered to suppress such meetings, the German government's pressure has kept the government's hands tied. Subsequently, Franz Anton Basch, the leader of the Volksbund is growing bolder, as each rally become even grander than the previous one."
twrhungary.1.a:0 "Let's hope this goes smoothly..."

twrhungary.2.t:0 "A Scheme in Hungary"
twrhungary.2.d:0 "Over the years, the Kingdom of Hungary has become increasingly paranoid of the German presence in the nation's affairs. As a countermeasure, the Volksbund under Franz Anton Basch has designed a cunning plan. With the Schutzstaffel's approval, the upcoming German Rally in Hungary shall turn into a "radical march" with Schutzstaffel funding, demonstrating the consquences of defying German interests. Hopefully, this plan would be a firm warning for the Horthy regime and solidify Germania's influence."
twrhungary.2.a:0 "A "gentle" nudge."

twrhungary.3.t:0 "Budapest Bloodbath"
twrhungary.3.d:0 "As the Germans gathered, things took an unexpected turn for the worse.\n\nWithout warning, the Volksbund members formed themselves into several columns and began marching towards Budapest. Police officers were unable to contain all of the participants and around a hundred radicals entered the streets of Budapest, causing an extensive amount of damage on local businesses and pedestrians. It took the authorities several hours to fully control the situation.\n\nThe nation was shocked by such news, and rumours of Volksbund members being armed with Germania backing began circulating around the capital."
twrhungary.3.a:0 "Curses!"

twrhungary.301.t:0 "Zoltan Boszormeny Seeks to Return"
twrhungary.301.d:0 "After years of exile in Germany, Zoltan Boszormeny has expressed his desire to return to Hungary in a letter directed towards Miklos Horthy. In his letter, Boszormeny has also promised to not involve himself into Hungarian politics, simply wanting to return and live a peaceful life in his homeland.\n\nZoltan Boszormeny was a leading exponent of Fascism in Hungary, and founded the National Socialist Party of Work (Scythe Cross) in 1931. Evetually, his failed coup in 1936 resulted in his exile. And since then, Boszormeny has became largely irrelevant in the fields of politics.\n\nShould the government allow his return?"
twrhungary.301.a:0 "Let him in."
twrhungary.301.b:0 "Stay out!"

twrhungary.4.t:0 "Emergency Cabinet Meeting"
twrhungary.4.d:0 "Shortly after the incident a few or so hours ago, Regent Miklos Horthy summoned an emergency cabinet meeting, discussing matters related to the recent violence in Budapest.\n\nDue to the fact that these meetings were held behind closed doors, no official statements were made by the government. After the brief meeting, Miklos Horthy greeted journalists from the state media, assuring the public that "Hungary shall remain steady on her course to greatness and prosperity." While none are certain on what Horthy meant, trusted sources are suggesting that drastic changes might come soon."
twrhungary.4.a:0 "A time of changes?"

twrhungary.5.t:0 "The Investigation"
twrhungary.5.d:0 "Appointed by the regent, a swift and secretive investigation was conducted on the secrets behind the recent incident in Budapest. A conclusion was reached, confirming the rumours that Germania was indeed supporting the agitators. The reports detail a Schutzstaffel project, equipping members of the Volksbund with smuggled firearms. This scheme's ultimate goal is to sway the Hungarian nation onto the side of Germany with political violence and radicalization.\n\nIt is now up to the government to decide a response. Hungary can either choose to release this information to the world, confront the Germans in secret, or classify the information."
twrhungary.5.a:0 "The world needs to know!"
twrhungary.5.b:0 "Confront the Germans in secret."
twrhungary.5.c:0 "Classify the information."

twrhungary.501.t:0 "A Message From Budapest"
twrhungary.501.d:0 "Issued in secret by the Hungarian embassy, the Horthy regime has discovered the perpetrators behind the Volksbund attacks.\n\nDespite the public sentiments, due to Hungary's close relationship with Germany, the Kingdom of Hungary has chosen to not publicly announce this information, instead choosing to confront Germania in secret, in the hopes of resolving this matter gently with Germany's consent.\n\nWhile the Hungarians are only asking for a secret apology. However, the fact that Germany might have to admit fault is upsetting for most warmongers within the cabinet."
twrhungary.501.a:0 "Issue an apology, in secret."
twrhungary.501.b:0 "Ignore their messages!"

twrhungary.502.t:0 "Germania's Apology"
twrhungary.502.d:0 "A reply from Germania has arrived, the Germans have acknowledged their involvement in the Volksbund's activity, vaguely admitting their fault and expressing sympathies for the incident's victims."
twrhungary.502.a:0 "Good."

twrhungary.503.t:0 "No Reply From Germania"
twrhungary.503.d:0 "As the days go by, our message to Germania has seemingly been ignored, with no replies in sight.\n\nIt seems that Hungary's efforts to maintain a trustful relationship with her partner has failed."
twrhungary.503.a:0 "So be it!"

twrhungary.5011.t:0 "Hungary Denounces German Agents"
twrhungary.5011.d:0 "Days ago, an incident instigated by the Volksbund resulted in a violent riot in Budapest. While police investigations led to the arrest of several members immediately afterwards, the government sanctioned investigations came to the conclusion that "German agents with strong ties to the Schutzstaffel" were behind the violence, with their activities being funding the Volksbund, equipping radicals, and encouraging the leadership to demonstrate violence, in the hopes of radicalizing the political scene of Hungary.\n\nWhile Germany and the Volksbund denied these accusations, the people of Hungary are generally convinced, greatly souring the already damaged relationship between Hungary and Germany."
twrhungary.5011.a:0 "Interesting..."
twrhungary.5011.b:0 "Hands off Hungary!"
twrhungary.5011.c:0 "Curses!"

twrhungary.6.t:0 "Meetings With the High Command"
twrhungary.6.d:0 "Following recent development, the Royal Army is paying close attention to the government's decisions. With a firmly Anti-German command corp, a meeting was called by the regent, reaffirming the military's loyalty to the Horthy regime. With this reassurance, the military has sworn to stand for the stability of the nation."
twrhungary.6.a:0 "Together, for stability!"

twrhungary.7.t:0 "The Vacant Throne"
twrhungary.7.d:0 "Upon Hungary's defeat in the Great War, attempts at restoring the throne were foiled time and time again. In the end, it resulted in Miklos Horthy's regency, leaving the Kingdom of Hungary without an actual king.\n\nEnough time has passed, and considering recent events, the government has once again opened the door of discussion, attempting to make a decision on what to do with the Hungarian throne. While the government can choose to appoint a committee to handle the issue, the Regent himself can make a decisive choice on behalf of Hungary."
twrhungary.7.a:0 "Let a committee handle it."
twrhungary.7.c:0 "On second thought..."

twrhungary.701.t:0 "Royal Committee"
twrhungary.701.d:0 "With a list drafted by parliamentarians, solutions for the throne question were formalized for the committee. The politicians were quick to narrow the possibilities down to three viable options - A proposal by the Social Democrats, calling for the outright abolition of the monarchy after the reign of Horthy; a pragmatic plan to crown an Italian to deter German aggression; and a traditionalist proposal calling for the return of Habsburg rule, though it should be known that the Habsburg claimant is currently residing in the United States.\n\nAfter the discussions ended, these three final options were presented to the government..."
twrhungary.701.a:0 "The pragmatic option is accepted."
twrhungary.701.b:0 "Maybe the Habsburgs deserve a second chance..."
twrhungary.701.c:0 "The Social Democrats have a point."

twrhungary.8.t:0 "Contacting the Legation"
twrhungary.8.d:0 "When Germany's relation greatly deteriorated with the United States, the diplomatic services their respective sides grinded to a halt. However, the Americans have maintained a small legation in Budapest, performing basic functions as a diplomatic legation.\n\nGermany as a partner has grown to be a threat for Hungary national sovereignty, it is now time for Hungary to explore new options, and perhaps meet with the legation representative to discuss about the future."
twrhungary.8.b:0 "Request support."

twrhungary.802.t:0 "Hungary's Message"
twrhungary.802.d:0 "According to our information, Hungary is currently undergoing a policy shift, seeking to distance themselves from the German regime.\n\nOur legation in Budapest has relayed a message to Washington, requesting future support on the behalf of the Hungarian government, giving us an opportunity to establish control in the region when the time is right."
twrhungary.802.a:0 "Accept their request."
twrhungary.802.b:0 "Turn them down."

twrhungary.8021.t:0 "Washington Accepts"
twrhungary.8021.d:0 "Understanding Hungary's situation, the United States of America have promised us support, increasing the diplomatic status between the two nations and providing Hungary with a safety net."
twrhungary.8021.a:0 "Good."

twrhungary.8022.t:0 "Washington Refuses"
twrhungary.8022.d:0 "Sadly, Washington has refused to support Hungary, instead choosing to give us empty comments."
twrhungary.8022.a:0 "A shame."

twrhungary.9.t:0 "Minority Military Formation"
twrhungary.9.d:0 "With our decision of putting these refugees to a better use, volunteers from neighbouring fascist regimes have formed a military formation, loyal to the Hungarian government.\n\nThis formation is made up of ethnic Hungarians, Croatians, Bosnians, and many other minorities that have escaped to our nation."
twrhungary.9.a:0 "Service guarantees citizenship!"

twrhungary.10.t:0 "The Night of Torches"
twrhungary.10.d:0 "Over the radio, paramilitary cells across our urban centres were activated by the command of the national government, permitting radicals to perform unspeakable crimes against the refugees who have evaded deportation. However, these cells took the matter one step further, enacting pogroms across the nation, executing Jewish citizens "in the hopes of purifying Hungary." While the government did not order the killing of jews, it was reported that some police officers assisted the radicals in the mass killings.\n\nAfter a night of misery and brutality, life resumed as normal the next day, seemingly out of fear or apathy."
twrhungary.10.a:0 "..."

twrhungary.110.t:0 "Radicals Increase Activity"
twrhungary.110.d:0 "Recently, the fascists and the Volksbund have increased their activity in Hungary, arranging frequent meetings to attract more followers."
twrhungary.110.a:0 "Keep an eye on them."

twrhungary.11.t:0 "Arrow-Scythe Alliance"
twrhungary.11.d:0 "The National Socialists of Hungary have been unified under the support of Germania, becoming an influential force in Hungarian politics.\n\nAs the new government seeks to secure political support and approval from the powerful German minority, the National Socialists have been formally invited to the government, forming a political alliance with the National Socialists with a series of compromises."
twrhungary.11.a:0 "Together, for Hungary!"

twrhungary.12.t:0 "The Horthys' Fate"
twrhungary.12.d:0 "Currently held in protective custody in a secret location, the Horthy family is under our absolute control.\n\nIn the past, the Arrow Cross Movement heavily criticized Horthy's policies and ideology, and now with Horthy under fascist control, it is now time for us to determine their fate once and for all. We might be able to remove this threat once and for all by granting them the privilege of facing the firing squad, but we could also show our malevolence by allowing them to live under our supervision."
twrhungary.12.a:0 "Keep them in captivity."
twrhungary.12.b:0 "Line them up against the wall."

twrhungary.121.t:0 "The End of the Horthys"
twrhungary.121.d:0 "Former Hungarian dictator - Miklós Horthy and his family were escorted to a square in Budapest, placed before a kangaroo court and were sentenced to be shot.\n\nAs the Horthys were lined up against a wall, Miklós Horthy's requests of giving a speech as his last words were denied by the executioners, therefore they were quickly positioned then executed by a firing squad. Many in the nation were against this execution, but none were brave enough to speak out against the regime."

twrhungary.121.b:0 "There goes the bastards."

twrhungary.13.t:0 "Emergency Stability Act"
twrhungary.13.d:0 "Under the supervision of the military, the little democratic symbols of Hungarian system has been further reduced.

twrhungary.13.a:0 "Politicians destabilize the nation."

twrhungary.14.t:0 "Apor Appointed the Regent of Hungary"
twrhungary.14.d:0 "Since the Regent Horthy's reign as a powerful dictator, the military has made several amendments, greatly reducing the power of Regent more akin to a symbolic role. Therefore, with the military government feeling the need to appease the population, the administration has decided to appoint bishop Vilmos Apor as the country's new regent.\n\nBorn into the nobility as a baron, Vilmos Apor turned to being a bishop, earning great fame among his peers."
twrhungary.14.a:0 "A new puppet."

twrhungary.15.t:0 "Budapest Defense Pocket"
twrhungary.15.d:0 "The threat of war is slowly encroaching on Hungary's borders, therefore the military is now pushing for the fortification of Budapest.

Powerless against this coup, the government has no choice but to let him in, proclaiming Szálasi as the new dictator of Hungary. With such radical ideas and a drastic change in direction, Hungary will undoubtedly experience great turbulence in the upcoming months.\n\nFascist street thugs have began to vandalize undesirablle properties, as political violence steadily worsens..."

After ascending to power as regent in the newly created Kingdom of Hungary, Horthy worked diligently to ensure his nation's freedom which only led him into an unstable alliance with a new Nazi Germany. During Hitler's crusade in Europe, Horthy refused to relinquish most of his Jewish population to Germany and housed many minority groups and refugees. This lack of collaboration between the two nations forced Horthy to forge his own path for the Hungarian nation in the years following the war. Whether or not he is seen as a dictator, Horthy now faces a troubling political climate where the Germans surround him and the Romanians are eyeing to strike at any moment. While Horthy might be an admiral without a fleet, only time will tell whether or not he will be a Hungarian without a nation."

Szalasi_DESC:0 "Ferenc Szálasi, born in Kassa, son of a soldier father and a Greek Catholic. After finishing primary school in his hometown, Szálasi followed in his father's footsteps and enlisted in the army, graduating from the military academy in 1915 when he was promoted to lieutenant. During the later advancement in his career, he became an officer of the Austro-Hungarian army and was soon transferred to the front, but he only stayed for 36 months, where he spent waiting for the war to end.\n\nAfter two coups broke out in the Hungarian government, the first under the Democrats while the second was under the leadership of Bela Kun, he remained apolitical and watched from the sideline. Once again applying for military training between 1921 and 1929, he went from academy to academy with high praises, receiving promotions until 1933. By then, he was disappointed by Hungarian policies on the issue of lost territories, he published a 46-page pamphlet which advocated the return of the borders of Hungary, the so-called "Hungarianism". Since soldiers and members of the General Command had no right to interfere in politics, and all those who agreed to implement his plan were fired or regretted their decision, this led to his resignation in October 1934. After his National Socialist Party's collapse in 1937, the Arrow Cross Party was created after Germany performed the Anschluss. Szálasi was proclaimed the leader and won 30 seats in Parliament in 1939, becoming one of the strongest parties in Hungary. After the outbreak of the European War, his party suffered another blow, but under amnesty after the Vienna Award in 1940, the Arrow Cross returned with German support, watched closely by the government after the end of conflict on both fronts.\n\nFollowing the tensions that developed in Budapest, Szálasi realized that the corrupted government has failed the people. And now, it is finally his time to enact his radical ideals, especially his beliefs on "a-Semitism"."
Zoltan_Boszormeny_DESC:0 "Zoltán Böszörmény, born on January 5, 1893, is the prime example of an egomaniacal attitude towards National Socialism in striving to establish his ideas, believing that he is the only one created fore the mandate entrusted to him as a prophet. His family was bankrupted and in his youth, Boszormeny meddled with some strange jobs, only to start flirting with politics in 1919, when he criticized the actions of Bela Kun, despite being relatively unknown at the time.\n\nAfter the end of the Great War and the Hungarian-Romanian war, he attended university and became a self-proclaimed poet, publishing poems with the help of two individuals, people that also became involved in his return to politics. Boszormeny formed the National Socialist Party in 1931 and met with Hitler, he was increasingly attracted by the Nazi system. As an egomaniac and a "intellectual giant", Boszormeny expanded his political movement, eventually taking inspiration from Mussolini's March on Rome, leading a failed revolution against the state, which would result in his exile to Germany.\n\nIt has been a long time since Boszormeny had any influence on Hungary's politics, and a successful conspiracy would finally bring him to power after all these years. But, as many years passed, has Boszormeny's ideology shifted beyond his initial beliefs?"
Baky_DESC:0 "Born on September 13, 1898, László Baky is a military academy graduate that rose to prominence in Szeged in 1919 for his violent counterrevolutionary work and rose through the ranks to become one of the leading figures in the Gendarmerie. As a member of several far right groups he finally left the gendarmes in 1938 (as a major-general) to join the Hungarian National Socialist Party. In 1939, he was elected as a deputy representing the National Socialist coalition group.\n\nBaky grew closer to Nazi Germany, eventually becoming a strong proponent of Nazi ideology and German cooperation in Hungary."
Lakatos_DESC:0 "Born on April 30, 1890, Lakatos graduated at Ludovica Military Academy. He served as a military attaché in Prague from 1928 to 1934.

Tildy served as an active minister of the Reformed Church beginning in 1921, and became an editior of several papers. In 1929, Tildy joined the Independent Smallholders' Party (FKgP) with other noted Hungarian political figures, including Ferenc Nagy. Soon after, Tildy became the executive vice-president of the organization.\n\nIn 1933, Tildy was elected to the Hungarian parliament, and was reelected in both 1936 and 1939. He placed pressure on the Horthy administration to distant themselves from Germany, and would later become the leader of the FKgP."
