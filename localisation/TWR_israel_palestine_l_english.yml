twrisraelpres.1.t:0 "대통령의 죽음"
twrisraelpres.1.d:0 "시오니즘의 창시자이자 철학자, 정치가이자 과학자인 고인이 된 이스라엘의 대통령 하임 바이츠만은 죽었지만, 그가 건설한 국가에서 살아온 많은 삶들을 이어갔습니다. 1904년 벨라루스에서 태어난 바이츠만은 독일에서 화학자가 되었지만, 그의 일생은 결코 시험관이나 가설이 없었으며, 유대 민족을 위한 유대국가에 대한 그의 끊임없는 노력이 일생을 지배했습니다. \"법이 아니라 민족의 힘에 의해... 유대민족이 팔레스타인에 도착한다면, 유대국가는 현실이 될 것입니다.\"\n\n벨푸어 선언과 영국 시오니즘의 형성에서 영향력 있는 역할을 한 바이츠만은 영국과 아랍의 많은 국가들과 긴밀한 관계를 맺었고, 유럽이 파시즘에 의해 몰락함에 따라 증가하는 유대인 이민자들의 유입을 받아들이도록 노력했습니다. 그의 유대 단체는 믿을 수 없는 서방세계에 대한 최종 해결책의 악몽을 확인하는데 도움을 주었고, 1948년 전쟁에서 이스라엘을 팔레스타인 위임통치령과 그 지역에 세울 토대를 마련했습니다. 이제는 고인이 된 대통령은 많은 국가의 외교관, 영국 관료들, 그리고 그의 친구들에 의해 애도되고 있지만, 그가 안정을 되찾기 위해 노력했던 국가는 살아남았고 다윗의 시민들이 그것을 보존하는 한 그의 기억은 영원히 살아있을 것입니다."

twrisraelpres.3.d:0 "Hero and shepherd to the Jewish people, Chaim Weizmann lived a life as controversial as the state he helped build. Born in 1904 in Belarus, Chaim became a qualified chemist in Germany, but it was in the halls of London that he would achieve fame and prominence - as a foundational leader of Zionism, Weizmann was influential in guiding and advising British authorities in the gradual formation of a Jewish network of settlements in Palestine, against the objections of Arab leaders.\nHis covert Jewish Brigade infiltrated Nazi soil and discovered the black horrors therein, partially leading to the subsequent establishment of the State of Israel within the Confederation. Under his managementm Israel has managed to establish a functioning democracy under the gazes of those who would see it wiped from existence."

twrisrael.0.d:0 "The man looks tired as he steps off the plane's narrow stairway onto the ground of the Promised Land. Ragged hair puffed up in lack of sleep, hollowed eyes, wrinkled face: Albert Einstein has seen better days, that is for sure. But the crowd loves him for it, cheering: banners welcoming the Messiah (the term is only half in jest) fill the airport as Einstein makes his way to the hotel to convalesce from his long flight. His car is met with such attention the Police of Tel Aviv are called in to escort a non-diplomatic civilian for the first time in Israel's short history. And around him the cheers grow and grow. Einstein has agreed to return to Israel to speak to crowds in the University of Tel Aviv, and then to deliver a special address to the American people from Jerusalem itself. Einstein has also expressed his intention to visit and speak with students from both Palestine and Israel - a proposition which has for the most part been met with enthusiastic acceptance. Several news agencies are already scrambling to find inroads into Einstein's circles to secure interviews and exclusive rights - something which the Government is extremely uncomfortable with, but has little choice but to accept. One issue has already made its way into the headlines, however, the man refuses to attend any military parades or duties, citing his personal discomfort with militarism. To say that this is controversial is, well, an understatement."
twrisrael.1.d:0 "Einstein shuffles his papers at the podium, surrounded by students in suits and ties - all silent, like they're watching a Maestro. He never liked giving speeches, they struck him as too adoratory for comfort, and it's only gotten worse now that he's famous. In the old days back at Bern and Zurich the presentations were accompanied by a chorus of giggling and whispers, even in his position of professor. Perhaps it was better then.\nHe clears his throat and speaks. He reminds the audience that he was not brought here to say things the Israelis would like to hear: and he begins this trend by talking of the Black Stain In Europe, the monstrous silence that has arisen in the lands where the Ashkenazis once dwelt freely. From France to West Russia the Jews have all gone silent, the old calls to prayers in the synagogues built by ancient hands wiped clean as a phonograph set too close to a fire. The establishment of Israel is, he says in a hushed tone, a paradox that engages the consciences of the whole world, and its cause for existence is something so monstrous it is hard to speak of by name. He stresses the necessity of Arab-Israeli peace and Israeli cooperation with its neighbours, just as he calls for the dulling of tensions from many in the Arab community - it is a demand for justice that the world needs more than ever, and the Arabs must limit hostility, not inflame it. And he tiptoes around the subject of Zionism, stating only that Israel's relations with its neighbours must be motivated by universal peace and brotherhood. He avoids any mention of the Army, something which will surely inflame many Generals.\nApplause, everywhere, ringing like a bell in an old tower. All around the surge of the crowd overwhelms him, and then a thud to his left leaves him sprawling. Funny, he thinks, as the red stain spreads across his chest. To get shot at a speech in the City of Peace. Funny indeed. And then - "
twrisraelnews.1.d:0 "World-renowned physicist and German-born Jew, Albert Einstein, has visited Israel on his first visit to the Holy Land as a nation, having previously visited Palestine in 1923. Einstein has promised to address students and the American people from various locations in the Israel-Palestine Confederation, including the University of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem itself. Einstein's visit, motivated as much by the recent death of Chaim Weizmann as by the establishment of the Israeli nation within the Confederation, is greeted with international acclaim and general celebration. Einstein remains in his own words a committed Zionist, and has declared his intention to help encourage peace and prosperity in Israel-Palestine, although many expect him to also speak on prominent social issues and the geopolitical elephant in the room..."
twrisraelnews.2.d:0 "The world mourns today as the body of eminent physicist Albert Einstein is returned to his Jewish relatives in Princeton. Eulogies are pouring in from world leaders in the wake of the senseless attack - the American Government has declared a National Day of mourning, and the Israeli government has followed suit. Einstein was delivering a speech at the University of Tel Aviv when he was assaulted by a gunman claiming allegiance to a Palestinian separatist group - there he suffered fatal wounds leading to his death. Palestinian grassroots agencies have collected thousands in Einstein's name. Einstein, it appears, will be remembered for his fight against the evil of violence, not his eventual loss to it."

ISR_aliyah_desc:0 "Now is a dark time for the Jewish people, and the Aliyah, the 'going up', has never been more relevant. The few Jews that escape Hitler's Europe, telling horrific tales of the horrors therein, are joined by the hundreds of thousands from across the Middle East and beyond, some from as far afield as America, coming together in the newly created Jewish state of Israel. Finally, many the Jewish people have a homeland and thousands of lost people are coming home."

Across the world, the Jewish people are under a greater threat than ever before, and it falls onto us to hold the bastion of safety for our people, with force of arms if necessary."

By forming governments with like-minded yet, smaller political parties, Mapai has been able to maintain control over the Knesset, enacting a variety of progressive policies for the citizens."
JLM_member_of_confederation_desc:0 "United into a loose and unstable Confederation, the two states of Israel and Palestine share a military alliance, a capital territory in Jerusalem and little else. Though the union created by the British has held uneasily so far, serious doubts remain as to whether this great compromise can stand the tests of the future."

POLITICS_GURION_DESC:0 "What defines a servant? Is it the cause he wears on his sleeve and braids into his heartstrings? Is it the man or the team he imitates? Is it the loyal and trusting heart? David Ben-Gurion is all of these things and more, and yet he has become the most powerful follower in the state of Israel for his loyal, unquestioned service to the Jewish people. A career in Palestinian politics, brief military action and statesmanship has allowed Ben-Gurion to assume the position where he can pursue the interests of the Israeli State - if he can keep it. For his heart burns bright - but the fire burns hotter.\n\nDavid, born in Poland to a Jewish lawyer and his wife, quickly took to interest in politicking and Jewish affairs - this was only honed by his studies in Thessaloniki, where he studied with Jewish men and women far removed from the humble townsfolk of his birth. It was there that he took up the name Ben-Gurion, after a leading Jewish general in the Second Jewish-Roman Revolt, hoping to gain something of the fire that drove that ancient warrior. Ben-Gurion's next thirty years would be spent hopping from one position to the next in senior Zionist legislative bodies. His restraint in managing Palestinian and Jewish ownership of disputed played a key role in soothing tensions during the Arab Revolt of the late 1930s and the acceptance of the Bipartite Plan that created Israel-Palestine.\n\nThrough the Aliyah, through the war against Syria, through the trials that buffeted the young state Ben-Gurion has persevered, and now the statesman is determined to forge a path for the young nation under his wing just as he shepherded its predecessors in the interbellum era. What Weizmann guided into being Ben-Gurion aims to lead to maturity - if that means that the Jewish people must make the deserts bloom around them, well, the Jews have always desired the impossible. And Ben-Gurion is nothing if not a servant of the Jews."
