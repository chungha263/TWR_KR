Returning to the concept known as Czechoslovakia may be the nations only chance at independece, and redemption."

 SLO_The_Second_Election_desc:0 "It is finally time to hold another election. The first election was held in 1938, when we still were part of Czechoslovakia, with the term supposed to end in 1943, however by decision of the Diet itself their term was prolonged to 1946. In reality the actual first election of our state was held in 1947 and so now, after 5 years of serving the Deputies will be reshuffled. Just like in 1938 and 1947, we will be the only party on the ballot. In 1938 our manuever was to not inform any other party of the election sooner than the day before election, this time, however, there are no other parties as they have all been united into the Hlinka's Slovak People's Party-Party of Slovak National Unity. Whoever goes into the backrooms to choose, instead of tossing the ballot right in, will be suspected of treason as per our master's decision."

 SLO_Chairman_Of_Government_Tuka_desc:0 "After the election, President Tiso victoriously delivered a speech at the Grassalkovich Palace, which serves as the seat of the President. He delivered the exciting news that our party has won the election with the turnout being 98%. Of course, citizens are required by law to vote, which is one of the few laws still in place from the Czechoslovak era and the only good one. President Tiso has also announced the creation of our 8th government with Vojtech Tuka becoming the Chairman of Government, serving as head of government. Although our party has been doing all it can to suppress dissent, there are rumors around, attacking our President of kneeling to Germans and the appointment of Tuka being ordered from Germany. While this is true, we cannot allow the citizens to attack our President like this!"

We need to reevaluate our position in Europe, otherwise we won't stay free for long. The political sub factions within our country are already fighting each other and even the parties, which seemed united, are now tearing themselves into either individual politicians influential enough to stand by themselves or political voting blocs, organized to promote or oppose the regime.

Even the Diet is growing in opposition to the current rule. The military and even Ministers Karvaš and Čatloš are calling this event "Slovak Spring" as if we are experiencing beautiful period and of new growth. President Tiso has decided to dismiss Vojtech Tuka, instead chosing Karol Sidor from the moderate wing to serve as the new Chairman of Government.

The failures of Tuka government during the crisis made the President free in the eyes of the formal parliament to reappoint a new Chairman of Government. Tuka has been pushed out of the public eye for now and resigned at the private request of the President to make sure the government seemed united. Tuka will still have a mandate in the Diet, but he is expected to withdraw from politics in a few years unless something changes. After all of this political maneuvering we held another election, where we, once again, were the only party. The German influence still pushed us to appoint a radical Chairman of Government, however, this one is not the mastermind entirely, unlike Tuka.

One of the people the Reich wants gone is Tiso, idolized by the Office of Propaganda to be the Fuhrer or Vodca of Slovakia, similarly to Hitler, however, unlike him Tiso did not have all of the power. At the meeting of the Party leaders, we presented Tiso with a motion to resign from the post of President and Chairman of the HSĽS, letting him leave with dignity. He accepted when the Gestapo marched into the room, which was sort of our trump card. Now after his resignation the parliament becomes de facto leader, normally the powers of President would be given to the Chairman of Government if a President resigns or dies, however, these are extraordinary times and we have already drafted an amendment to the "constitution". The Slovak Diet will execute the powers of the President until the next President is chosen."

 twrslovakstart.1.t:0 "A Slovak Republic"
 twrslovakstart.1.d:0 "Slovakia is a complicated piece of history and geopolitical mess that emerged in the world scene during the second half of the 1930s. Representing a kind of aspiration for separatism since the inception of Czechoslovakia, the Slovak Republic seeked independence from their unwilling union. After the Reich occupied the Sudetenland by the Munich Agreement, the rest of Czechoslovakia was soon occupied by the Wehrmacht. In March of 1939, the First Slovak Republic "gained" its "independence" in the form of a German puppet regime led by Jozef Tiso and Vojtech Tuka.\n\nDuring the European War, Slovakia did not play any significant role in the conflict. Throughout the Eastern Campaign, Slovakia served as a way station for the Reich to exploit the Slovakian economy. After the end of the brutal campaign in the east, Slovakia collapsed into general economic domination by the Reich, which bankrupted Slovakia.\n\nToday, Slovakia is facing a major crisis - the economy is destroyed, the army is almost non-existent, and the political establishment is currently burning from within. On top of that, Czechoslovak rebels remain undefeated in the Slovakian mountains, an extra ingredient for a disaster."
 twrslovakstart.1.a:0 "What lays ahead for Slovakia...?"
 slovakia.1.t:0 "Protests at Slovak University"
 slovakia.1.d:0 "The collapse of German authority has raised doubts about the legitimacy and strength of the Tiso Regime. A crowd gathered on the grounds of Slovak University, demanding the Slovakian Government sever it's ties with former Axis nations and uphold Slovakian nationhood. Leaflets and speeches brought more and more people to the University, and the numbers of protestors grew drastically. The guards sent by Slovak Government reported that they are outnumbered and will not be able to control the situation, with some even being reported to have joined the protestors."
 slovakia.1.a:0 "Send in reinforcements!"
 slovakia.2.t:0 "The Bratislava March"
 slovakia.2.d:0 "The chanting crowds, disappointed at the lack of official responds for their demands, decided to march towards government buildings in Bratislava. During the marches, bystanders joined, the call for reform turned into chants for the removal of Tiso. The police that were sent to control the crowds had no choice but to retreat, however the protestors were finally stopped at the gates of the Government Office. They were greeted by a line of soldiers and sandbags, armed with rifles and standing tall against the protestors."
 slovakia.2.a:0 "End this pesky protest!"
 slovakia.3.t:0 "Bratislava Coup d'etat"
 slovakia.3.d:0 "Shockingly, when the soldiers were commanded to open fire, they refused the order and defected to the protestors' side, opening the gates of the Government Building to the protestors. Later on, the Slovak Armed Forces have declared their open defiance against the Tiso Regime, proclaiming their loyalty to the Slovakian people. With Germany unable to reinforce him, Tiso received advice from Germany that he should seek support from Horthy's regime in Hungary to crush the disloyal military forces and end the revolt, while the military offered Tiso safety if he promises to surrender his power to the new regime."
 slovakia.3.a:0 "Seek Hungarian support!"
 slovakia.3.b:0 "Tiso agrees to resign."
 slovakia.4.t:0 "Hungarian Control"
 slovakia.4.d:0 "Hungary accepted Tiso's request and has directed a division of Hungarian soldiers to Slovakia. While the Hungarians effectively crushed the rebellious Slovakians and kept Tiso's regime in power, in reality, Slovakia has surrendered its rights to Hungary, becoming a facto puppet state. Was this the right price to pay for stability?"
 slovakia.4.a:0 "Well, as long as I am in charge..."
 slovakia.5.t:0 "Hungarians Refuse"
 slovakia.5.d:0 "The request made by Tiso has been ignored by Hungary, and the Slovakian military has successfully captured Tiso and his cabinet. While the military ensured their safety, they were forced to resign and surrender to the new Republic."

 slovakia.6.t:0 "Hungarian Invasion"
 slovakia.6.d:0 "The Hungarians, threatened by the thought of a public revolution so close to its borders, have announced the newly created Republican Government illegal and used the excuse of "Restoring the Rightful Slovak Government" to launch a full scale invasion into Slovak lands. While most believe that this war is a lost cause for Slovakia, citizens from all ages are volunteering to defend the small nation. The young cabinet hopes to hold off the Hungarian offensive for long enough to gain a chance for peace negotiations."
 slovakia.6.a:0 "Slovaks! Unite!"
 slovakia.7.t:0 "The Vodca's Disgrace"
 slovakia.7.d:0 "Jozef Tiso, autocrat and founder of the Slovakian nation, has been forced out of power not with a fight nor a revolution but with a sigh and perhaps a sense of silent gratitude. His senality and ineffectual rule has lead to Slovakia's German ‘advisors' growing dissatisfied with the current national leadership, after all how is the Germanic sphere meant to present a strong united front if one of its first members is lead by an old fool! At the behest of orders from Germania itself Stefan Tiso, the Vodca's own cousin, has come forth to the assembly of the Slovak republic with a wide range of accusations from attempted reformism to gross abuse of power. The vote to depose Jozef Tiso was near unanimous, German supervisors made sure of that. In the aftermath of such a vote Stefan Tiso, a devoted party man and proud pro-German loyalist, expected that he would be granted the position as the new vodca of Slovakia however it seems that other interests within the Slovakian government have been eyeing u p the position. \n\nAlexander Mach, minister of the interior and de facto head of the Hlinka Guard, has been making preparations of his own to seize leadership. The influence of the Hlinka Guard has spread across our armed forces, their brutes gerrymander members of the government into siding with them and their ties with the SS has made Mach a favourable successor in the eyes of our German benefactors. \n\nIf Mach were to take control than it would spell an end for Stefan Tiso and his entire clique and the implementation of a new and terrifying ultranationalist agenda as well as the expansion of the Hlinka guard into all sectors of Slovakian society much in the same vein as the German SS, however if Stefan Tiso were to hold on and grab this rare opportunity of power than it would secure German support for his own faction and prevent yet another expansion of the Hlinka faction. \n\nUltimately the only way to legitimately secure power for both of the competing factions is to be appointed successor by the Slov akian assembly and the successor is…"

 slovakia.8.t:0 "The Communist Offer"
 slovakia.8.d:0 "Recently, representatives from all socialist and communist parties of Slovakia arrived at our front door with a proposal in hand. Having focused on our own national identity due to the war with Hungary, the United Slovakian Red Front have proposed the co-operation of our government with their united party in order to fight as one united people. \n\nOn one hand, having the communists on our side will result in a stronger Slovakian people, on the other hand we would have to conceed parts of our government to those Bolsheviks..."

 slovakia.8.b:0 "We don't make deals with Bolsheviks!"
 slovakia.9.t:0 "The Second Election"
 slovakia.9.d:0 "It is finally time to hold another election. The first election was held in 1938, when we still were part of Czechoslovakia, with the term supposed to end in 1943, however by decision of the Diet itself their term was prolonged to 1946. In reality the actual first election of our state was held in 1947 and so now, after 5 years of serving the Deputies will be reshuffled. Just like in 1938 and 1947, we will be the only party on the ballot. In 1938 our manuever was to not inform any other party of the election sooner than the day before election, this time, however, there are no other parties as they have all been united into the Hlinka's Slovak People's Party-Party of Slovak National Unity. Whoever goes into the backrooms to choose, instead of tossing the ballot right in, will be suspected of treason as per our master's decision."
 slovakia.9.a:0 "Long Live Slovakia!"
 slovakia.10.t:0 "Chairman Tuka"
 slovakia.10.d:0 "After the election, President Tiso victoriously delivered a speech at the Grassalkovich Palace, which serves as the seat of the President. He delivered the exciting news that our party has won the election with the turnout being 98%. Of course, citizens are required by law to vote, which is one of the few laws still in place from the Czechoslovak era and the only good one. President Tiso has also announced the creation of our 8th government with Vojtech Tuka becoming the Chairman of Government, serving as head of government. Although our party has been doing all it can to suppress dissent, there are rumors around, attacking our President of kneeling to Germans and the appointment of Tuka being ordered from Germany. While this is true, we cannot allow the citizens to attack our President like this!"
 slovakia.10.a:0 "A New Chairman, A New Age."
 slovakia.11.t:0 "The Direction Of Our Economy"
 slovakia.11.d:0 "With the depressing state of our economy, Chairman of Government Tuka and President Tiso, need to appoint a new Minister of Economy to pull us out of this depression. Right now the decision is ours. Do we go with the Governor of the Slovak National Bank? A great economist, however, a disloyal one. He might be the only one able to pull us out of the depression, but at what cost, if it in the end costs us the unity of our party and eventual destruction of this virtious religious government and dive into another criminal liberal democracy?\n\nOn the other hand, there is the Party Secretary Július Stano. Although not an economist, he is a pretty good organizator and has been serving as the Minister of Transport and Public Works since 1938. He has also been apponinted the General Director of the Slovak Powerplants. He might not be able to pull us out of this economic depression, but he is loyal! And at the end of the day, economy is a small price to pay for the safety of our entire government, right?"
 slovakia.11.a:0 "The Governor!"
 slovakia.11.b:0 "The Secretary!"
 slovakia.12.t:0 "Blood, Sweat, And Tears"
 slovakia.12.d:0 "The Minister of Finances joined the Minister of Economy in front of the Slovak National Theatre, both of them delivered a speech, commenting on the recent state-sponsored jobs as well as increase in foreign investments.\n\n"... only thanks to hard work of the Slovak nation will our state be able to lift itself from the ashes of the old Czechoslovakia. With our own forces we will build our home, an independent free Slovak state. Every citizen can help, by taking up the state on the offer of the state-sponsored job at the Slovak Powerplants or by simply taking a Loan of Economic Revival...""
 slovakia.12.a:0 "Pain Is Temporary, Industry Is Permanent."
 slovakia.13.t:0 "An Economic Miracle"
 slovakia.13.d:0 "Today the Minister of Economy has delivered a victorious speech at the Slovak University, formerly Comenius University, which serves as the proud seat of the Slovak Diet since 1938. In his speech Minister of Economy said some questionable things, however, due to the success of his reforms, President Tiso has decided he will remain on the post.\n\n"... our path has always been, is and always will be hard and tidious, however, we have finally managed to rebuild our economy, which is, as far as I am concerned, the most important department of our state. It is only thanks to our economy we will be able to continue developing "democracy" of this Republic. It is thanks to your continued sacrifices my dear Slovak nation. It is thanks to you we have been able to industrilize Eastern Slovakia and bring wealth to the region forgotten by the former Czechoslovak Republic. On behalf of the entire government, our Chairman of Government Tuka and our great President Tiso, I would like to thank all of you, who contributed to our economy this year. We have even managed to repay what we used to owe to the Germans. Perhaphs next year, we might be able to afford a new building for the Diet and finally resume all operations of the Slovak University.""

In his speech, the Minister said all that is expected from a state official, even though little of the actual truth has been told to the citizens. Never let the truth get in the way of a good story, right? although the State Council and the President suspect him of being a puppet to the Chairman of Government, however, due to rather popular reforms, President decides to keep the Minister on his post.\n\n"... it indeed is our responsibility to continue building our great nation. Our economic reforms have helped us to regain favour the eyes of our guide throughout this century as the Germans have forgiven us for our continued requests for help. Thanks to the effords of the Chairman of Government, Dr. Vojtech Tuka, the Ministry has been able to secure all which is needed to continue developing this wonderful nation. On behalf of the entire government I promise you, within a year we will build a new building for the Diet of the Slovak Republic and resume all operations of the mighty Slovak University, the educational centre of our State. No longer is our economy restrained by the effects of the old Czech liberal centralization, taking away the freedom of all Slovaks and destroying the Slovak religion.

While in the past we have tried deporting them, we must now agree that only together we will be able to survive against our master. We have noticed an increase in Slovak population and the laws regarding taxes have proven themselves even better than expected. With more citizens, more people will be able to pay taxes in the future and while we expect to lose some money in the short-term, we should be able to profit economicall in the long-term. Even Tuka and Mach have to agree, that the moderate wing this time did well. Regarding the idea of the New Slovak, it failed. While most Slovaks are still religious, they started to resent the government's efforts to enforce religion and it's restrictions on non-Catholic religions. The biggest reason for this is the promise we have failed to deliver; free elections and the long-lost democracy of  the former Czechoslovak Republic. On the other hand, citizens appreciate our new position to help the Czechs we previously persecuted."

With their request via government decree and with no consent of the President, nor the parliament, the Cabinet has decided to take on many German "colonists" to "civilize" the Slovak lands. The President has learned this too late, otherwise he would attempt to stop them, however, Once the Germans arrive, there is no way of kicking them without angering our master and so Tiso stands down."

The clerical moderate wing of the party does not approve of this and while Tuka's Cabinet is backed by the Germans, who knows what might happen to Tuka if he continues with these matters... Of course no murder, but false accusations wouldn't hurt the clerics. The tensions between the President and the Cabinet are at all time high regarding this issue, with President publically declaring his support to end the pro-German stance, lobbying for the end of the compulsory German language education in schools for example. Germans haven't really decided which side to support, when Tuka declared he is only building a great relationship. Tonight, Tuka wants to pass a bill through the parliament. Do the Deputies leave in order to not show disunity, but at the same time not vote on the bill, or do they vote for it and continue Germanization?"

While Tuka is not fond of the policies of President Tiso, this time the Cabinet thinks it is best to inform him, instead of trying to meet without him with the rest of the Cabinet. In the end we came up with a solution. We cannot resists our master's wishes, we can counter-attack. We will quickly increase the Slovak population. We will decrease the amount of taxes families with 5+ children pay, while we will increase the tax of families with less than 5 children and single individuals without a family. We will also add more state benefits to families with a lot of children into the mix."

With excitement the Chairman of Government decided to hold a press conference in front of the Ministry of National Defence, without informing the President, where Catlos is supposed to speak on behalf of the government, informing the citizens of the military situation.\n\n\"... although our army is strong thanks to the efforts of the entire nation, there is always room to raise the potential and eventually reach it.

While some of these gatherings have been resolved by Mach's HG units, we are not able to effectively control all of the cities and towns these protests are happening in without the help of the German Gestapo. No laws have passed through the Diet lately as almost all Deputies always left when a law restricting the citizens even more has been presented. It seems that the radicals have lost all faith within the Diet and the opinion of the Deputies is for appeasement. The military and even Minster Karvas and Catlos are calling this event "The Slovak Spring".

We join Slovakia and get the protection offered by their bigger army, which will be reinforced with our small units and gaining access to their bigger economy and budget, while we keep our autonomy in form of "regional laws" and policies. The highest office here would become the Governor of Subcarpathia, while the Slovak Cabinet would accept a new ministry - the Ministry for Subcarpathia, which could only be occupied by nominees put forward by the elected Governor. The deal also guarantees a creation of the Regional Diet of Subcarpathia, which would be an elected body of 50 members, voting on those regional laws.

The first candidate is Ivan Dérer, chairman of the Labour Party and an influential figure, however he also promotes Czech and Slovak unity - Czechoslovakism. The other choice is Jan Ursiny leader of the Democratic Party after Viest resigned, problematically he is more conservative than the National Council would like and the Democratic Party itself has shifted more towards conservativism under his wing."

Tuka will still have a mandate in the Diet, but he is expected to withdraw from politics in a few years unless something changes. After all of this political maneuvering we held another election, where we, once again, were the only party.

This is all window dressing, but privately Esterhazy has been our agent ever since the times of the Czechoslovak Republic, where he worked, as a Deputy to the National Assembly for the Hungarian minority party, against the republic, hoping to restore Hungarian rule in Slovakia. He informed us that Tuka is weak, old and sick. He will have the control of the nation in a few years, meanwhile we should start with some Hungarization Acts. One of these will be the state funded mandate of teachers and clerks in Slovakia, where they will work in administration, getting paid by the Slovak government, our government and provided housing.

At the meeting of the Party leaders, we presented Tiso with a motion to resign from the post of President and Chairman of the HSĽS, letting him leave with dignity. He accepted when the Gestapo marched into the room, which was sort of our trump card. Now after his resignation the parliament becomes de facto leader, normally the powers of President would be given to the Chairman of Government if a President resigns or dies, however, these are extraordinary times and we have already drafted an amendment to the "constitution".

 Slovak_Diet_DESC:0 "Serving as a remnant of the former Czechoslovak democratic system, the Slovak Diet took over as the parliament of the nation, representing minorities as well. Some minorities are more equal than others and some of those even have more say than actual majority of Slovaks, but we do not talk about that.\n\nThe Constitution is in favor of the executive, however, the Diet still has enough power as legislature. As for if how it works is actually democratic is up to interpretation. If Deputies disagree with the law, which is being passed, they are to leave. If too many of the Deputies leave then the law is not passed. By too many one should understand more than 2/3 of the Diet itself. The voting is more of a formality really. Laws are discussed way before they are given up for a vote and if the Cabinet feels like it would not get passed then they do not put forward the law to the Diet. With the recent amendment passed by the President Tiso, the Diet has become more powerful, becoming itself the de facto President of the country until an actual one is elected. This makes things messy, but with the constant intrigue this makes the balance between President, executive and the Diet a lot more like an actual balance, instead of a completely rigged system."
 Vojtech_Tuka_DESC:0 "The most radical of all the radicals. A politician, attorney and a professor, Vojtech Tuka has headed the radical club of the Hlinka's Slovak People's Party since 1918. In 1923 he founded Domobrana - The Home Guard, a paramilitary group, predecessor to the Hlinka's Guard. Sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment in 1929 for high treason and espionage, released in 1937. He served as a martyr for the ľudáci, as were members of the HSĽS dubbed. Since 1938 he supported the shift of Slovakia towards Germany and he has been serving as the Slovak Chairman of Government since 1939.\n\nAll his public speeches and people around him paint him as an extreme anti-Semite. The architect of the deal to deport Jews into Germany for money and a sympathizer of the Nazi ideology. One of his devoted followers is Alexander Mach, the leader of the Hlinka Guard. His ideal Slovakia is a Slovakia run like Nazi Germany. Privately, he would rather see Slovakia as part of Hungary again than as part of Czechoslovakia."
 Jozef_Tiso_DESC:0 "A politician and a Roman Catholic priest, Jozef Tiso headed the Slovak People's Party since 1938. After the collapse of Czechoslovakia, Jozef Tiso was offered the position as the president of a 'Free', 'Independent' Slovak Republic under German influence, an offer which Tiso welcomed with open arms.\n\nBeing a priest during his early days, Tiso fought against local poverty and alcoholism in Slovakia, in which his deeds have been overshadowed by the portfolio that he built as the President of Slovakia. According to the Czechoslovak National Army in Slovakia, Jozef Tiso is brutal in terms of suppressing any types of resistance, with a dark history of collaborating with Germany in deportations of Jews."
 Rudolf_Viest_DESC:0 "A Czechoslovak Legionary, War Academy graduate, the first and only Slovak general of the Czechoslovak Army and the Inspector-General of Slovak Army, Rudolf Viest was one of heads of the Slovak resistance movement since his return in 1941. He fled the new Slovak State in 1939 to become the leader of the exiled Czechoslovak army, however, after the defeat of the Allies in the West he returned to Slovakia and was officially pardoned by the President to be used as a propaganda tool.\n\nAs a Czechoslovak Legionary he always felt more like a Czechoslovak than a Slovak and remained connected to people with democratic ideals. Thanks to the Minister of National Defence, a fellow resistance member, he was able to convince the party of a giant change in his view of the world and left essentially unwatched by the party as he plotted against it and the "state". According to colleagues, Viest is a just, rational and skilled man. A perfect military and democratic leader."
 Alexander_Mach_DESC:0 "Mach joined the Slovak People's Party at an early age and came to prominence within the movement as an aide to Vojtech Tuka. Under Tuka's tutelage Mach served as editor of the party newspaper  Slovák (Slovak) and Slovenská pravda (The Slovak Truth) and was appointed to the party's political committee in 1924. He belonged to the radical non-clerical wing of the Slovak People's Party, later Hlinka's Slovak People's Party. He became an influential figure on party policy, and an editorial he wrote in 1938 calling for the establishment of a paramilitary arm of the party led, with Tuka's support, to the formation of the Hlinka Guard. Mach would succeed Karol Sidor as commander of Hlinka Guard in 1939.\n\nKnown for his rabble-rousing, Mach played a leading role in orchestrating the violence that followed the collapse of Czechoslovakia in March of 1939 in his role as head of the Slovak Office of Propaganda. He served initially as Propaganda Minister, after the defeat of Britain he was appointed Minister of Interior, as well as Minister of Propaganda. With his influence he has been lobbying for concentration camps in Slovakia for the last 10 years, unsuccessful in his goals, Mach has become more disillusioned with the clerical wing than ever and is willing to defend Tuka at all cost."
 Jan_Ursiny_DESC:0 "A protestant priest and a politician, Ján Ursíny has been credited as the head of the civilian Slovak resistance. He represents the conservative liberal ideology of the resistance as the informal Democratic Party. He served as a friend to the Czechoslovak (Slovak) Minister Chairman (Prime Minister) Milan Hodža. Ursíny, however, despite his Hungarian surname, is a convinced nationalist, opposed to the fascist rule. He has a great knowledge of politics and geography, as well as a great foresight, allowing him to prepare for some situation, which might be difficult down the line.\n\nAfter the end of Czechoslovakia, he was watched as a protestant priest, as the Slovak government was a clerical Catholic fascist proto-dictatorship. He was part of the resistance from the start and was great at hiding things away. As the war ended the agents watching him got a break in 1942, hoping to cut government spending. The government also shifted towards Christian unity at the time. This allowed him to fully engage himself with the movement and him, Dérer, Viest and Golian were considered leaders or the Insurgent National Council by 1950."
 Ivan_Derer_DESC:0 "A lawyer, politician and a journalist. This member of the social democratic party has always claimed to be a Masarykist at heart, with pragmatism, centrism and Czechoslovakism at heart. A signatory of the Martin Declaration, it broke his heart when Czechoslovakia was destroyed just 2 years after the death of the Czechoslovak father. He has a lot of experience with politics and administration, serving in many cabinets at many ministries. He remained in Prague, stripped of his Slovak citizenship by the new Slovak government in 1939 and joined the resistance movement. He later found himself in the concentration camp Terezín in 1944-1946, released thanks to the intervention of the Slovak President.\n\nHis release was a deal he made with Jozef Tiso. He would serve at low ministrial posts and claim he got rehabilitated, that he was blind before and now finally he is able to see the total sovereignty and independence of an actual Slovak nation. However, he used his time to fight against the government he was serving. Without money, the government wasnt able to pay agents to look after Dérer and because of his long inactivity he was considered as a small threat to the state. The opposite was true. With the help of the other pro-resistance Ministers, he was able to shake off all of his tails and finally engaged with the resistance again in 1950, serving as one of the leaders."
