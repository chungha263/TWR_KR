#### Politics ####
GGR_Goerings_Reich:0 "Göring's Reich"
GGR_Goerings_Reich_desc:0 "Throughout the recent political crisis in the Reich her future was unclear, but through his cunning mind Hermann Göring has taken the mantle of the Fuhrer. With adversaries from both sides coming down on him hard he will have to solidify his control by making concessions, and perhaps rolling some heads if need be."
GGR_Economic_Policies:0 "Economic Policies"
GGR_Economic_Policies_desc:0 "Now that we're in power, it's time to rethink some of those economic policies that we've been using for all too long now. Ham-fisted direct intervention into the market has added benefits, but they're shaky in the long-term. The flexibility of relying upon the market itself has proven to be easier to adapt to changes, mitigate potential harm, and spurn economic growth even faster than if executed by the state. The invisible hand of the market has proven time and time again to be the purveyor of direct benefit upon both the individual and the corporation. We've seen it in America for years now. If we apply the economic mindset of our most staunchest opponent, then we can surely beat them at their own game! The propaganda value of such would be enormous."
GGR_RK_Back_In_Fold:0 "Back In Control"
GGR_RK_Back_In_Fold_desc:0 "Perhaps then it is time to take a hands-off approach to planning the economy. Instead of bureaucrats within the Economics Ministry slaving over a desk trying to determine which goes where, we can leave it to those who're less easily stumped and can see the writing on the wall much clearer. Of course such men are the heads of the various conglomerates that dominate the private sector of our economy. These men have had years of experience - Each of them sees what makes the economy tick, what makes it improve, decline, or fail. It is preposterous that we do not have more of these men in economic positions within our government! A room full of these businessmen can achieve an entire decade's worth of a bureaucrat's efforts in a single afternoon. \n\nBring me the contact list - I have a few meetings to arrange."
GGR_Peoples_Will:0 "People's Will"
GGR_Peoples_Will_desc:0 " The people have always loved Göring, despite his eccentric personality and dress, they view him as a self made man of the people. Though the recent division of the Reich has diminished him in the eyes of more partisan people, the average German still views him with that same admiration. To maintain support of the German People turning to popular opinion for some minor reforms may ensure they maintain their loyalty for the foreseeable future."
GGR_The_Power:0 "The Power"
GGR_The_Power_desc:0 "Hitler's rule was full of cronyism, and it shows, now that he is gone the incompetent political appointments are breaking down. To say they have no skills in their profession would be accurate, but to say they have no influence would be a blatant lie. We must either cast them out or win them over, and either way we must reorganize their offices."
GGR_Man_Of_The_People:0 "Man of the People"
GGR_Man_Of_The_People_desc:0 "Göring has always been seen as down to earth by the average German. He came to prominence in the Great War after taking command of Jagdgeschwader I after the famed fighter ace Manfred von Richthofen was shot down, and since then has only continued to grow higher up in the ranks of the Reich. To many this from rags to the Reichs Fuehrer has made many citizens from the lower classes see him as one of their own, and has presented Göring with a masterful opportunity. He has a very large, if ignorant, power base to bring him even more legitimacy to pull on."
GGR_New_Age_Of_Progress:0 "New Age of Progress"
GGR_New_Age_Of_Progress_desc:0 "The old ways suited the Reich fine for the past years, but if our beloved Fatherland is to survive it must change with the times. A mass revitalization of the industry, a careful lax in censorship, and loosening up of social laws are needed to progress."
GGR_NatSoc_With_Goering:0 "National Socialism with Göring Characteristics"
GGR_NatSoc_With_Goering_desc:0 "The System as it is is decadent, impractical, and corrupted. There is no way the Reich can survive if it is not changed, and so change it we will. We will cut down the ideological dogma and unnecessary bureaucracy at its roots, and make a more practical system from its timbers."
GGR_Revisit_Operation_Reinhard:0 "Revisit Operation Reinhard"
GGR_Revisit_Operation_Reinhard_desc:0 "The system established in the Wannsee Conference is proving to become unsustainable. In our attempts to answer the question of our genetic adversaries we have created a bloated program that burns man power, time, and money."
GGR_Labour_Camps:0 "Labour Camps"
GGR_Labour_Camps_desc:0 "Instead of wasting time, and resources, on the extermination of untermensch putting them to work for the Reich would mutually benefit all parties involved."
GGR_Deportation:0 "Introduce Deportation"
GGR_Deportation_desc:0 "We have installed a work program for the untermensch, but they are unwilling to work for us. Perhaps if we offered them a reward they would be more inclined to work, and have divided a most suitable reward. Any person who is currently in a Work Camp who works for 5 years will be allowed to immigrate to any nation outside of the German Reich or her international holdings."
GGR_The_Deeskalation:0 "The Deeskalation"
GGR_The_Deeskalation_desc:0 "The Americans are always on edge with us, and we don't blame them - historically we have not been on the best of terms. We however need to set aside our differences and focus on our common desire not to blow our nations into a new dark age. We will do our best to not be as confrontational as we have in the past, and even give some ground here and there."
GGR_Diplomatic_Ties:0 "Diplomatic Ties"
GGR_Diplomatic_Ties_desc:0 "We have yet to establish any significant ties across the Atlantic. This has led to many failures to communicate at the worst possible times, and this is unacceptable. To avoid a worldwide calamity we will reach out and expand our existing diplomatic sources."
GGR_And_Hitlers:0 "...and Hitler's Reich"
GGR_And_Hitlers_desc:0 "Though Göring and Hitler had many differences the German people loved Hitler, and any condemnation at this point would tank our popularity. Paying lip service to the former Fuhrer is a sure fire way to win the favor of all but the most revolutionary of reformists."
GGR_Nazi_Roots:0 "Our National Socialist Roots"
GGR_Nazi_Roots_desc:0 "Even though we wish to go forward with our changes it would not be wise to change too much. We don't wish to rock the boat to the point it sinks, and in this case rocking it too much would cause her passengers to rip her in two. We must tone down our reforms to a point where both extreme reformist, and party hardliners are satisfied."
GGR_Crack_Downs:0 "Crack Down on Oppositions"
GGR_Crack_Downs_desc:0 "Sure we have loosened up censorship laws, but there are still ideologies we will not tolerate. The judeo bolshevik scum cannot be allowed to corrupt the greatest nation on earth. No matter what they call themselves subversive ideologies will be snuffed out before they grow larger."
GGR_Loyalty_From_All:0 "Loyalty of All Aryans"
GGR_Loyalty_From_All_desc:0 " The Aryan people must know that we have their backs, but our support will only be reciprocal for their undying loyalty."
GGR_SS_Only_In_Burgundy:0 "The Schutzstaffel in Burgundy"
GGR_SS_Only_In_Burgundy_desc:0 "The SS has long been a pain in the side of Germany. They bitch, and bitch, about our degenerate behavior and how it is ruining the sanctity of the Aryan Race. Though for now it has only amounted to strong words and occasional hollow threats, we need to satiate them before they do something that could seriously harm the Reich. We have decided to carve them out a piece of land in our conquered lands of eastern France called 'Burgundy', and hopefully that will get them to be more compliant."
GGR_Confidant_Government:0 "Confidant's Government"
GGR_Confidant_Government_desc:0 "People in our government need to know that what is said in their workplace should stay in their workplace. To drive the point home, anyone who is found to have compromised state secrets will have an even harsher sentence than in the past."
GGR_The_Cultural_Masters:0 "Man of Culture"
GGR_The_Cultural_Masters_desc:0 "Though we've proven our race the best at warfare, technology, and manufacturing, people know little of the joys we hold culturally. Our film industry is nothing more than propaganda, our art is under constant scrutiny by the censorship bureau, and the music is the same as the films. For all our greatness we are viewed as dull people, and the eccentric Goring has had enough. We must undergo a Renaissance to show the world how creative the Aryan mind truly is. To do this we will create subsidies for art, movies,and music, and relax censorship on said materiels."
GGR_Prussian_Traditions:0 "Prussian Traditions"
GGR_Prussian_Traditions_desc:0 "Twice we have reunited Germany in a century, and though we have maintained the Reich well enough we must take lessons from our Ancestors. In knowledge there is power, and in history knowledge. We must study into what has led us to victory in the past. Additionally, a return to Prussian military culture would suit us quite well as opposed to the decentralization the Wehrmacht has faced in the last decades."
GGR_Eternal_Reichs_Commander:0 "Eternal Reichskommandant"
GGR_Eternal_Reichs_Commander_desc:0 "To ensure the continued loyalty, growth, and success Göring must take direct command of all military assets and all major decisions must lie in his hands before they go through."
GGR_Empower_Honour:0 "Empowering Honour"
GGR_Empower_Honour_desc:0 "The Wehrmacht has become increasingly burdened by the disease of idleness. The men are unmotivated, the lower ranks of officers are inexperienced, and the upper echelons have been stacked with political appointees. Aside from a costly purge we have another option, and that is simply to give the men incentives to fight. Lowering qualifications for Medals, higher pay, and more leave would most certainly be adequate to make sure the men are willing to fight."
GGR_The_Goering_Medals:0 "The Medals of Göring"
GGR_The_Goering_Medals_desc:0 "Always a prideful man Hermann Göring wears his various medals with pride, and the people love it. These medals symbolize a rise from poverty to the greatest office in the Reich, and he wishes to share his pride. As such he wishes to hold an annual event where he, televised, gives multiple awards to the greatest individuals the Reich has to offer."
GGR_Symbol_Of_Greatness:0 "Symbol of Greatness"
GGR_Symbol_Of_Greatness_desc:0 " The Reich has triumphed time and time again. We must prop up this image as the last bastion of western values in an ever degenerate world."
GGR_The_Trust_System:0 "The Trustee System"
GGR_The_Trust_System_desc:0 "It is quite simple you show us we can trust you, and if you have proven such we will. Why waste time watching the citizens we know are loyal, when there are actual subversive elements that require our attention."
GGR_Hands_Off:0 "Hands Off Approach"
GGR_Hands_Off_desc:0 "What has an iron fisted rule brought to us ruin and collapse. Sure we could continue to waste money on monitoring every single person in the Reich, but how about we take a step back. We don't need to control everything, and trying has just shown the futility of it."
GGR_Public_Fundings:0 "Public Funding"
GGR_Public_Fundings_desc:0 "Our schools, hospitals, and other public utilities are critically underfunded. We should inject some cash into our public utilities."
GGR_Improve_Public_Agencies:0 "Improve the Public Agencies"
GGR_Improve_Public_Agencies_desc:0 "Our Public Agencies are critically overwhelmed, and underfunded. Bureaucracy isn't pleasant, but it's necessary for any government to function. We will divulge more funds to improve these vital tools, and raise the pay to attract new employees."
GGR_Leave_The_Plans_To_Others:0 "Let Others Plan"
GGR_Leave_The_Plans_To_Others_desc:0 "Perhaps then it is time to take a hands-off approach to planning the economy. Instead of bureaucrats within the Economics Ministry slaving over a desk trying to determine which goes where, we can leave it to those who're less easily stumped and can see the writing on the wall much clearer. Of course such men are the heads of the various conglomerates that dominate the private sector of our economy. These men have had years of experience - Each of them sees what makes the economy tick, what makes it improve, decline, or fail. It is preposterous that we do not have more of these men in economic positions within our government! A room full of these businessmen can achieve an entire decade's worth of a bureaucrat's efforts in a single afternoon. \n\nBring me the contact list - I have a few meetings to arrange."
GGR_The_Four_Year_Plans:0 "The Four Year Plans"
GGR_The_Four_Year_Plans_desc:0 "A key aspect of quick economic growth with lingering long-term benefits is the Four Year Plan - At this point just about as integral to the German identity as sausage, bread, and Bavarian beer. While dictated by the state, it is a key guider of economic growth and industrial development - alongside with advances in the armed forces. For this specific four year plan, we can continue to focus on growth of the military and it's refinement of technology and equipment. The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht has long petitioned the government for further research and streamlining of current methods. It was the great Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt who stated at a training exercise last year that "A strong army is one that has all of it's affairs in order - From the methods of production to it's equipment being up-to-date." We should follow such advice."
GGR_The_Ground_Productions:0 "Ground Productions"
GGR_The_Ground_Productions_desc:0 "The key component of a ground army is it's equipment - Rifles, rockets, artillery, and everything in between. It is imperative that we also streamline the output of these to ensure that each division has them readily available. The worst thing any commander has to fear is any portion of his unit running out of artillery shells in the middle of a barrage - Or even worse, his soldiers having their clips run dry in the heat of battle. As such, production must both be able to meet the demands during wartime and easily build up stockpiles during peacetime. Never again should a battalion prematurely run out of necessary supplies or ammunition for equipment, lest they open themselves up to attack by the opponent."
GGR_Fundings_For_The_Bomb:0 "Fund the Bomb"
GGR_Fundings_For_The_Bomb_desc:0 "In this new "cold war" Germany finds itself in, there now exists a strange game - One where the winning move is often not to even play. Of course, this strange game is the current state of affairs with regards to conventional warfare, an avenue that sees itself largely being overshadowed by one monolith: The atom bomb. Utilized extremely effectively by the Americans during their war with Japan, the atom bomb is a weapon that has the ability to entirely reshape the field of battle just by having them in one's nation. As such, it is highly advised that we throw our hat in the ring, to both have leverage with the western powers and a potential way to launch a counterattack in the unlikely event that such weapons are ever let free again. Göring himself has expressly stated a keen interest in further shoring up funding for research into the development of an stockpile of atomic weaponry for the Reich. It is only natural that we spurn it into motion."
GGR_Air_Quotas:0 "Air Production Quotas"
GGR_Air_Quotas_desc:0 "Many things in the Reich operate on a "work-as-needed" basis. While some have pointed out that this has it's own benefits, the prevalence of negatives is far greater. Since the relative calm after the war, production of all manner of air equipment, be it fuselages, engines, tools, and even cockpit weaponry - has been sluggish. A request for parts can be sent down to any run-of-the-mill factory and the blasted wait time stretches into month-long intervals, sometimes even more than that! Utterly ridiculous. A quick fix to whip this sorry state of affairs into shape is to simply implement quotas for all manner of air production. By ensuring that each factory meets their set quota of parts, we can once again begin to see a more smooth timeline of plane assembly not seen since the war."
GGR_Market_Reforms:0 "Market Reforms"
GGR_Market_Reforms_desc:0 "The chief aspect of our Führer, Hermann Göring's economic reforms is that of the market itself. For a considerable amount of time, we have called ourselves National Socialist - In political and economic matters. However any upper level (and practically spoiled) party bureaucrat will tell you that the economic system of the Reich is pseudo-socialist. Of course, such words are treasonous if spoken aloud, but the hushed assessment is somewhat true. Prior to the spurning of Göring's economic reforms, the economy operated under heavy state intervention, but a near-totally independent private sector, allowed to practically do whatever they pleased. This hands-off approach has of course brought numerous advantages and benefits to our economy, and the common citizen has been none the wiser. Göring's approach is simply tipping the scales a bit further in that direction - Retooling the economic model of the Reich itself to favor the old system of laissez-faire economics as well as reintroducing the gold standard. \n\nAll it took for money being backed by gold to fail stupendously was a global depression - Which is a testament to it's strong rigidity until the most extreme of circumstances. And you don't see a global economic crisis anymore, do you?"
GGR_The_Old_System:0 "The Old System"
GGR_The_Old_System_desc:0 "Laissez-faire economics is an economic model as old as time. It has served countless nations perfectly since it's implementation, and the reaping of benefits from it has been a much celebrated endless loop of success. Germany had shied away from such policies a long time ago, favoring the old state intervention model popularized by von Bismarck and the like. But now times have changed - The Führer and father of the new German nation, Adolf Hitler, rests eternally, departed gracefully from this Earth. And now new management is in charge. Leadership that has recognized that sometimes one must adapt with the rest of the world to equally see success. And such adaptation is, rather humorously and paradoxically, the return to that aforementioned old system."
GGR_The_Upper_Class:0 "Upper Class Policies"
GGR_The_Upper_Class_desc:0 "There does exist, to some extent, an upper class in Germany. The rich and powerful aristocratic societies of Germany remain unchanged from the Weimar era - A minuscule window into the past, so to speak. But it is rather small. In a nation where everyone can see themselves as great stalwarts of the Aryan peoples, from the lowly soot-covered coalminer in the Ruhr to the dashing, dressed-to-the-nines financier in Germania, it is only just that we develop such policies to expand a class that truly represents Germany as illustrious as it is. The bourgeoisie contribute far and wide to our economy, and in their privileged vacations to London, Montreal, New York, and Los Angeles, they are the face of German exceptionalism. We must reward these great men and women for being the shining star of the Aryan peoples - Showing that one can be great if they will it to be so."
GGR_Sweat_For_Reward:0 "Sweat Makes Profit"
GGR_Sweat_For_Reward_desc:0 "It is a simple idea to grasp, even to the smallest of children. Toil - sweat, makes profit. Through our hardworking men and women in all manner of employment within the Reich, their sweat, blood and tears drive the economy forward. Through their strength, we can experience joy - The motto (to some extent) of our nation's most successful state-run tourism program. Such benefits are absolutely deserved to the lower and middle classes of Germany. One should be able to experience leisure and comfort for the fruits of their labor, of which the nation greatly thanks them. It is through the many hands that work for the economy that it sees benefit and growth. Sweat brought us a stronger currency, sweat brought us an expanded economic and trade zone for the Reichsmark, and sweat brought us a renewed implementation of a truly free market for the Reich."
GGR_A_Free_Market:0 "Free Market Economy"
GGR_A_Free_Market_desc:0 "The free market is one of the most powerful things on this earth - Through the shifting words and actions of investors, bankers, and stockbrokers, nations rise, fall, and rise again. The power of paper money and metal coins has trumped even the mightiest of mythological beasts and deities. And it is time to reintroduce such a glorious system back into our nation once again. The public only grew disheartened with such an economic model when they became incredibly poor and the value of our money was so dreadfully worthless that it was being used as wallpaper. All of this was during the Weimar era, coupled with the Great Depression. Both of these aspects contributed to our smashing success in establishing our rule, and the economic reforms that brought us out of that economic crisis were quick and speedy. Now that we have been long recovered from such despair and then some, it is easy to forget the benefits of the invisible hand of the market. \n\nLet us remind the nation just how beneficial that hand is."
GGR_Currency_Controlled:0 "Control the Reichsmark"
GGR_Currency_Controlled_desc:0 "Along with taking a hands-off approach, a watchful eye and caring grip must be applied to other areas that could easily slip if not attended to as such. None is more so evident than the Reichsmark itself. With our recent loosening of some areas of the economy, along with taking a growing laissez-faire stance, our national currency has seen a rather steady growth rate - Bringing it up in value for the first time in quite a few years. The simple policy to apply to such is to allow the value of the Reichsmark to float, thus appeasing and meeting our goals for a free market economy, but intervening when necessary - Namely if poor showings on the market contribute to a decline in value, or inflation. Both of such are an unlikely possibility at the moment, but it is always extremely important to keep a close watch on such a thing."
GGR_Gold_Reserve:0 "Gold Reserve"
GGR_Gold_Reserve_desc:0 "Another key aspect of the Führer's free market reforms is the reintroduction of the Gold Standard. For the longest time, Germany and many other nations backed the value of their currency to that of gold - Which served them very beneficially for decades. However, the most extreme of circumstances, the Great Depression, finally broke the camel's back. The United States withdrew from the gold standard under President Roosevelt, and Germany under our Führer, Adolf Hitler, followed suit. What came next was many adaptations in monetary reform out of a result of no longer having paper money backed by bouillon, which eventually saved the Reichsmark and brought it back into prominence as a currency within international trade. Now that the Great Depression is long gone, written into the pages of history as a tremendous hurdle that we overcame in stride, the new Führer, Hermann Göring, wishes to return to backing banknotes by gold once more. Citing it as a way to brush away these many adaptations that we implemented, which seem confusing and unnecessary to economists now, Göring also believes that it would reestablish a sort of "rigidity" to the Reichsmark."
GGR_Encourage_Market_Government:0 "Encourage the Market"
GGR_Encourage_Market_Government_desc:0 "Whilst we have worked arduously to implement reforms that have established a more freer and hands-off market, few major corporations have been attracted or receptive to our efforts. Wishing to not be seen as an embarrassment or an outright failure in his plans, Hermann Göring has spent the past few days intensely meeting with the heads of several industrial conglomerates, chief financiers of major banking groups, and key stockbrokers across the various exchanges in the country. The main goal of his meetings has been the encouragement of private businesses to gradually wean themselves from the model they had been used to under the previous governments, and more warm up to the new government's reforms and changes. Göring has gone so far as to offer direct subsidies to corporations if they see profit losses upon adaptation to the new model - Surely as an effort to curry favor. Regardless, the Führer's careful reassurances have seemed to bear fruit - as more companies and stockbrokers have been injecting cash into private business than seen previously."
GGR_The_Big_Companies:0 "The Conglomerates"
GGR_The_Big_Companies_desc:0 "Read the economics section of any newspaper or see the large billboards in major cities and it'll be easy to see the key players in the major areas of the economy. These monolithic, almost mythical corporations guide the economy tremendously - Krupp, Siemens, Daimler, IG Farben, and countless others. Alongside their megalithic nature, they operate near-totally independent from the central government itself. This laissez-faire approach from previous governments has been loosened even further under the tenure of Hermann Göring, leading to large leaps in economic growth over the past few months. There have been some missteps, but these have been fairly minor. It is important that the government continue to foster the benefit of these institutions - For they are not just Germany's gateway to success within the Reich's own borders, but also the gateway to foreign markets, which brings with it a host of other opportunities."
GGR_The_Goering_Company:0 "Reichswerke Hermann Göring"
GGR_The_Goering_Company_desc:0 "A considerably large state-run industrial conglomerate and the most celebrated possession of the Führer, Hermann Göring - With it's symbol even apparently being styled upon his personal coat of arms, the Reichswerke owns considerably large shares of steel refineries, coal plants in the Ruhr, and ore refineries in Lower Saxony, mainly from the city of Salzgritter. It's recent expansion contributed to a host of new mergers and acquisitions, ballooning it even further and continuing to increase it's stake in the mineral and resource extraction industries. The Reichswerke also boasts itself as the largest employer in Europe - with a staggering 700,000 employees, up even further from it's long-held number of 500,000. Contributing an ample amount towards the economy, the Führer has stated his interest in collaborating with privately-held businesses with his Reichswerke to interconnect various sectors of the industrial economy, allowing widespread benefits across the board."
GGR_Company_Pacts:0 "Conglomerate Pacts"
GGR_Company_Pacts_desc:0 "The conglomerates already reap rewards for our economy on their own, but an interesting proposal has been laid out before the Führer's office lately. Perhaps even more growth can be achieved if the conglomerates meet with each other and form "pacts", so to speak. Several of them could group together, combining a variety of industries or clumping together many within the same market - Allowing for innovation on products, the advancement of production methods and technology, and establishing inter-corporate trade contracts and agreements, benefiting all who partake in them. The plan is nothing short of genius - With our Führer grinning ear to ear at such splendid proposals, even joking at his failure to not think of such an idea first."
GGR_Lufthansa_Expansion:0 "Lufthansa Expansion"
GGR_Lufthansa_Expansion_desc:0 "The flag carrier of the Reich, Lufthansa is the largest airline in Germany, and considered by some to be the second largest in Europe. The airline itself is the face of German tourism - With its fleet of planes, including its new sleek jetliners ferrying tourists to and fro from various international airports across the world, the swastikas on their tailfins emblazoned proudly for all to see. With both economic benefit and propaganda opportunities seemingly going hand in hand with such an industry, it has come at no surprise for the new government's plans to expand the large airliner. "Lufthansa is the edifice of the Reich's prowess in tourism," Hermann Göring stated before a luncheon with shareholders. "It shows that we are a modern nation and not a repugnant backwater as the west so devilishly likes to portray us - We must bolster their growth and then some. If our Luftwaffe controls the skies for combat, so too can Lufthansa control the skies commercially!""
GGR_Expand_The_Air_Might:0 "Expanding Our Air Might"
GGR_Expand_The_Air_Might_desc:0 "Our Luftwaffe is the largest air force in Europe - No doubt fighting to obtain it's spot for such a title globally as well. Our fighters have cut down countless enemies effortlessly, creating a beautiful array of fireworks and destruction upon the skies. Our bombers have laid waste to the festering hotbeds of degeneracy and Judeo-Bolshevism. Our close air support fighters have assisted the men on the ground valiantly fighting countless times. It is no doubt that we have crafted a well-disciplined and strong air force to rule over and stoically protect the skies. The Führer himself is a veteran of the air force, and a man who has long loved his Luftwaffe. As such, Göring has met with military leaders to discuss plans for further expansion of the air force alongside their modernization of equipment and doctrines - So that Germany can continue to cut through the clouds, watching her proud people and their cities below."
GGR_Profits_From_Companies:0 "Profits From the Companies"
GGR_Profits_From_Companies_desc:0 "The economic reports and monthly statistics have recently begun pouring into the Führer's office from the Economics Ministry. Out of pure joy (or perhaps too much opium), Hermann Göring has bounced up and down in his private quarters, giddy as a child. Profits have seen an all-time high after the reimplementation of laissez-faire economics and an establishment of a free market economy once again in Germany. Some foreign companies from our fiercest adversaries have also seemingly quietly started trading with German companies for the first time in years. Alongside a renewed foreign investment, German expansion into foreign markets has risen sharply in recent months, with the Scandinavian countries and Southeast Asian markets trading more increasingly since our reforms. All and all, the maneuvering and tireless work by our Führer in reshaping the economy into something truly great has bore the sweetest fruit imaginable."
GGR_Expand_The_Officers:0 "Expand the Officer Corp"
GGR_Expand_The_Officers_desc:0 "The officers of the German Armed Forces since their inception have  primarily come from the elite Prussian ‘Junker' class, along with this, our armies are still mainly commanded by veterans from the war, they are exceptional and brilliant but growing old, culmination of these and other reasons has led to the officer corp being understrength.

During our legendary Blitzkrieg in the 40s all the glory went to the Panzertruppen and the Luftwaffe, but in the end it was the traditional tactics taht whittled down massive enemy pockets, with the emergence of these new unconventional maneuver tactics the traditional warfare theories have been neglected, which are equal if not more important than unconventional warfare, our war academies have to re emphasise and bring back courses from the times of Clausewitz to ensure that traditional warfare tactics can keep up with unconventional tactics."

But in recent times the German technological advances have grind down to a halt, most notably the Uranprojekt which was barely completed,and the West has clearly achieved a lead in technology in the last few years, the Führer has been very worried about this widening \"technological gap\" and has necessitated the requisite funding and ordered the OKW to release servicemen with the proper technical background to expand and form new research divisions to get on par with the technology of the west."

With a general Post war disinterest in building up offensive capabilities and our resources primarily invested in the east to fight the Partisan movements there, the U boat arm of the Kriegsmarine has fallen behind in terms of strength and quality, the OKM has been ordered by the Führer to bring the U Boat fleet into fighting shape."

The OKM has propose and received the necessary approvals from the OKW to adopt a fleet of similar U Boat designs that will be flexible enough to be suitable for all tasks, these measures will reduce production time and allow adoption of similar training courses for all the U Boat crews, thus increasing yearly output of personnel from our Marineschules."

"Do your part to ensure the triumph of our greatness!", they'd emblazon upon posterboards in factories and assembly plants. Such a great spirit of fast-paced ingenuity and engineering. One that still occurs today, but not as frequent as we'd like to see. This is in part due to an overall lack of expansion of the diversity of the war economy itself. An economic planner can recognize the normal sights of a war economy - Bullets, rifles, machinery and vehicles, but he doesn't see the smaller, less thought of components that are just as useful. Them being radios, headsets, our enigma machines, and a host of other bits and bobs. Perhaps it is time then that we foster this expansion into these less-forgotten fields.

A normal Heinkel, for example, can take a whole month to complete, from the welding of the fuselage all the way down to the finishing quality assurance tests. When in reality, this process can easily have two weeks shaved off from it. By employing a few tricks and simplifying various aspects of production, we can ensure an even more efficient and speedy process to bring more planes and air equipment out to the Luftwaffe, without hampering overall quality.

It is not only incredulous that we have been making less use of such a fact, but downright idiotic that we have not been actively contributing to the growth of our economy through such means.

After all, it would not only be a tragedy to see men die at the expense of something faulty within the aircraft, but also an embarrassment to our reforms with such a regard - which would only hurl insults and condemnations our way. Along with this, it must also factor into the propaganda value - Quality, intensely tested designs for aircraft can be harnessed as a testament to the ingeniousness of German engineering, while also making the factory workers proud that they had assembled such a glorious machine by their own hands."

In this, he signalled the few western jouranlists in the hall, saying 'We have won the war against Jewish Bolshevism for decades', telling them that he is 'extending an olive branch by throwing the world a bone'.\n\nThe speech ended not long after, and the hall stayed silent."

First hurled at him for his engagement in the Anti-war crowd and his silent sympathy for the Germans. He of course had sternly refused this slanderous name by fighting viciously against the Japanese during the war, but even with the latter dying in nuclear hellfire, the ascendance of the German Reich had stuck his last title like glue to him.\n\nAnd considering where he was right now, this last name may even eclipse the former ones. Yet as he waited in the shade of an opulent pavillon in the garden of an even more opulent villa on the outskirts of Germania, he for the first time since the name had been given to him did not fret it anymore. For the meeting he was about to attend would forever prove his patriotism to America, because the man that now stepped out into the warm German sun was none other than the leader of the only country that could hope to best the United States on the battlefield: Hermann Göring; And he was here for peace, not war.\n\nGöring's enthusiasm shone brighter than the sun. Truly, Lindbergh thought this is the man to save both America and the world. At last the pointless standoff would come to an end! So he fully indulged Göring, proclaiming that he would make sure to make the man's words heard across the Western world.\nThe man yelled a toast to him and his country, but he didn't really hear what he said, nor really taste the ludicrously expensive champagne.\nHe was already deep in thought as to how this glorious news may be best made palpable to the American public.\n\nSo he remained lost in thought till his machine landed once again on American soil, but that's none of Germany's concern."

twrgoering.161.d:0 "In the summit, President [USA.GetLeader] has accepted our requests, officially recognizing the borders of the Greater German Reich. While some areas in Eastern Europe are still vaguely defined by the Americans, this is a great step towards legitimacy for the Greater German Reich and her people."
twrgoering.161.a:0 "Good."
twrgoering.161.b:0 "We want more than that!"
twrgoering.1611.t:0 "German Demands"
twrgoering.1611.d:0 "Seeing our willingness to recognize their borders as a sign of weakness, the German delegation has demanded further benefits. Calling for a free trade agreement, saying that this would \"benefit the people of Europe\", Hermann Göring is attempting to gain an upper hand over us."
twrgoering.1611.a:0 "We have come so far...sure."
twrgoering.1611.b:0 "Too far, no!"
twrgoering.1611.c:0 "We can not work with leeches."
twrgoering.162.t:0 "America Rejects Our Borders"
twrgoering.162.d:0 "Despite our attempts at peace, the Americans have refused to acknowledge our rightful borders, calling our territories \"unlawfully gained\". President [USA.GetLeader] seems to be misjudging the current situation, and has failed to realize that they are negotiating with the mighty Greater German Reich."
twrgoering.162.a:0 "...This is fine."
twrgoering.162.b:0 "So be it!"
twrgoering.17.t:0 "A Successful Summit"
twrgoering.17.d:0 "As President [USA.GetLeader] and Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring celebrated in the grand hall of Plaza Hotel, the world witnessed humanity's biggest event as of late. A room filled with nothing but cameras, under the witness of their respective delegates, President [USA.GetLeader] and Hermann Göring signed the \"United States-Germany Treaty of Understanding\", putting the efforts of maintaining peace and warming relations between both sides into official records.\n\nWhile nobody knows how long this peace would last, this is still certainly one of the biggest event in modern history."
twrgoering.17.a:0 "A toast to peace!"
twrgoering.1375.t:0 "United States Ends the Summit"
twrgoering.1375.d:0 "Due to some unknown reasons, the Americans have informed us that they are no longer interested in dealing with the Reich, calling for our return to Germany and the suspension of any planned talks."
twrgoering.1375.a:0 "So be it."
twrgoering.1376.t:0 "Ending the Summit"
twrgoering.1376.d:0 "Due to unsatisfactory results and the Americans' unwillingness for peace, Hermann Göring and the German delegation have made the decision to pull out of the summit, declaring the summit a failure."
twrgoering.1376.a:0 "Oh well."
twrgoering.1377.t:0 "America Declines"
twrgoering.1377.d:0 "Our negotiated demands have been declined by the Americans, making our terms invalid and redundant."
twrgoering.1377.a:0 "For the sake of peace, we tolerate..."
twrgoering.1377.b:0 "We are done here then."
twrgoering.1378.t:0 "America Accepts"
twrgoering.1378.d:0 "The United States of America has accepted our demands, making a wise decision for the sake of peace and humanity."
twrgoering.1378.a:0 "Good."
twrgoering.1379.t:0 "A Failed Summit"
twrgoering.1379.d:0 "Despite being the ones that suggested this idea, the Germans have performed yet another cowardly act, by walking away from a summit which they called for.\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] and Hermann Göring exchanged few words before the delegation's departure back to Germany, once again proving that the nature of human greed meant that peace is impossible."
twrgoering.1379.a:0 "As expected."
twrgoering.667.t:0 "American-German Summit Fails"
twrgoering.667.d:0 "Due to political complications, the United States of America and the Greater German Reich have failed to achieve peace by utilizing this summit.\n\nUpon the collapse of the summit, Hermann Göring and his delegation rushed to board their flight back to Germany, leaving after a brief farewell with President [USA.GetLeader].\n\nIt is clear that no such event would ever be held again for at least decades, and this attempt at peace has collapsed as millions correctly expected. However, this event has provided a once in a lifetime chance to witness neutral interactions between Nazi Germany and the United States."
twrgoering.667.a:0 "Peace was never an option."
twrgoering.668.t:0 "American-German Summit Ends"
twrgoering.668.d:0 "As the delegates from both sides gathered in a grand hall, the Germans and Americans have officially signed a joint declaration and the \"United States-Germany Treaty of Understanding\", agreeing to a compromise that both parties have agreed to. In a speech during the celebratory dinner, Hermann Göring praised the United States of America and President [USA.GetLeader], calling the President \"a wise and powerful leader\".\n\nAfter rounds of negotiations, the Americans and Germans have finally reached a compromise, a compromise that is welcomed by the laughters and hopes for a better, peaceful world order."
twrgoering.668.a:0 "Peace in our time!"
twrgoeringflavour.2.t:0 "The Fight Fails"
twrgoeringflavour.2.d:0 "Even with support and overseering by Germany's top medical experts, Hermann Göring is unable to defeat the urge of his morphine addiction. With his amount of authority, Göring personally cancelled his treatments and returned to his old habits of addiction."
twrgoeringflavour.2.a:0 "We shall try again!"
twrgoeringflavour.2.b:0 "Too much effort for nothing..."
twrgoeringflavour.3.t:0 "Addiction Free"
twrgoeringflavour.3.d:0 "Somehow, Hermann Göring has successfully overcame his drug addiction. Ordering his doctors to burn the remaining morphine stash, wiping the memories of his addicted past behind.\n\nWhile this glorious battle will not be reported to the public, Hermann Göring will certainly enjoy the fruits of this success."
twrgoeringflavour.3.a:0 "Very well!"
twrgoeringflavour.4.t:0 "Handling the Addiction"
twrgoeringflavour.4.d:0 "As the paramount leader of Germany, Göring's health is a major contributing factor for inspiring trust. A healthy leader means a healthy nation, as some might thought.\n\nHowever, hiding in the privacy of his manor, Göring's addiction is regularly appeased by doses of morphine. Some of Göring's daring advisors have suggested a drastic shift for his private life, strongly encouraging the leader to try his best to fight off the addiction and become an even more charming leader for the people of Germany."
twrgoeringflavour.4.a:0 "I see no problem with the addiction."
twrgoeringflavour.4.b:0 "Try to get rid of that addiction!"

In Göring's view, the rejection has provided Germany enough justification for expansion, as a form of \"offensive defense\" against the world."
