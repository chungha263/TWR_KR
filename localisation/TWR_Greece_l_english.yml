We do have two possible choices, one is to establish our own military and try to lure in one of the partisan groups to work for us.

That is true; it is a jumpstart to the industrial sector, and an unintuitive move at first glance. Doing so, however, will benefit local corporations and industry immensely by making imports more expensive, and will make our exports more competitive in the world market. Despite possible consequences with inflation, it is well worth it, as the benefits far outweigh the negatives."
GRE_Embrace_Shipping:0 "Embrace the Shipping Industry"
GRE_Embrace_Shipping_desc:0 "Although our industrial capacity for producing major amounts of goods is limited, we have many dockyards suitable for producing freighters and other shipping vessels.

GRE_New_Dockyards_desc:0 "Greece is in a great position to exploit the naval industry, with large ports and a very long coastline. By constructing dockyards across the nation, we will be able to use that to our advantage, constructing ships and naval vessels to use and sell to anyone."
GRE_Decrease_Import_Tarrifs:0 "Decrease Import Tarrifs"
GRE_Decrease_Import_Tarrifs_desc:0 "In order to stimulate our stagnant economy, a main idea of the Hellenic economists is to decrease the normally high import tariffs that have been held for some time. This will allow our growing industry to import goods at a cheaper price, and hopefully lead to an intense boom in our economic sector."

GRE_Rebuild_Major_Cities_desc:0 "Many major civilian centers such as the great city of Patras or the historic center of Thessaloniki have been in disrepair for some time. After the Invasion of 1940 and subsequent partisan hijacking across the nation, these cities have not gained enough support from the government to reestablish themselves, much less thrive and grow.

GRE_Mining_Sector:0 "The Mining Sector"

GRE_Hellenic_Army_desc:0 "The Hellenic Army is the largest and most effective branch of the Hellenic Armed Forces, but that does not mean it is in any way comparable to the grand Heer of the Germans or the Regio Esercito of the Italians. If we are to ever be a force to be reckoned with, this must change."
GRE_Equip_Security_Battalions:0 "Equip the Security Battalions"
GRE_Equip_Security_Battalions_desc:0 "The Security Battalions are the only force making up the Hellenic Army as of now. Established a decade and a half ago, they are ill-equipped, with mostly outdated small arms and severely lacking in artillery and howitzers, as well as many other items necessary in a modern army. It is due time that we begin a wide-scale modernisation and equipping campaign, so that they can once more be a suitable fighting force."
GRE_Request_Italian_Help:0 "Italian Expertise"
GRE_Request_Italian_Help_desc:0 "The Italian Regio Esercito, is, from all standpoints, a vastly superior force to the Hellenic Army. With our good relations, the obvious route to take is to hold the Italians in the highest of regards in terms of warfare, and perhaps even get some commanders trained in their art."
GRE_Rehabilitate_Officers:0 "Rehabilitate Republican and Royalist Officers"
GRE_Rehabilitate_Officers_desc:0 "Many of our best generals and commanders sided with the Republicans or Loyalist Monarchists after the fall of the Greek monarchy. This has caused a sizable gap in our military knowledge, and we would be massively assisted if these officers could return. We will allow them to do so."
GRE_Italian_Troops_Garrison:0 "More Italian Troops in Greece"
GRE_Italian_Troops_Garrison_desc:0 "If we wish to defend ourselves from any possible invaders or destroy the rampant partisan strongholds across the nation, the Hellenic Army obviously cannot do so alone. Until the State can expand and modernise its army, asking for Italian troops to be stationed here will be an excellent deterrent from indigenous and foreign foes alike."
GRE_Military_Base_Near_Bulgaria:0 "Joint Military Base near Bulgaria"
GRE_Military_Base_Near_Bulgaria_desc:0 "In order to help our commanders and soldiers learn and drill in the fashion of the other European powers, a plan has been drafted to construct a military base near the Bulgarian border. This base would have soldiers from the two major powers, Italy and Germany, and would allow our High Command to learn much in terms of warfare."
GRE_Learn_Germans:0 "Learn from the Germans"
GRE_Learn_Germans_desc:0 "The Germans are, unequivocally, the greatest fighting force in the world. Having toppled France in weeks and crushed the Brits in Dunkirk, as well as taming the Russian Bear, we will do good to emulate them in our policies. With German tactics and Greek spirit, we shall be undefeatable!"
GRE_Learn_Italians:0 "Learn from the Italians"
GRE_Learn_Italians_desc:0 "Italy, although not having the same triumphant and decisive victories as the Germans, still has a very strong and doctrinally modern army. With the terrain of the places where the Regio Esercito fought being very similar to Greece, they surely have superior tactics, specialised for our lands. Copying the Germans will not lead to success, as we are so different; with the Italians, we are perfectly alike."
GRE_Fight_Guerrilas:0 "Fight the Guerrilas"
GRE_Fight_Guerrilas_desc:0 "With our army modeled after a modern European power, we are ready to finally strike against the guerilla fighters that have been plaguing our nation for the past years. We shall push the traitors out of Hellas and into their graves!"
GRE_Rearmament:0 "Rearmament"
GRE_Rearmament_desc:0 "All sectors of the Hellenic Army are incredibly under-armed for their roles. Artillery batteries with only two guns, foot soldiers with barely enough ammunition for a day of fighting, and armoured regiments without any tanks at all are commonplace. If we are to ever improve, we must change this alarming state of affairs."
GRE_Indigenous_Production:0 "Indigenous Production"
GRE_Indigenous_Production_desc:0 "Greece must strive to be self-sustaining in terms of military production. If that is completed, never again will we lack the supplies to arm our forces, even if our military trade with other nations is disrupted."
GRE_Purchase_Foreign_Equipement:0 "Purchase Foreign Equipement"
GRE_Purchase_Foreign_Equipement_desc:0 "Greece lacks a powerful industrial basis like other major nations do. Instead of producing our own equipment, we can instead purchase arms from our allies, which allows us to trade our decently powerful economic power for military strength."
GRE_Reconstitute_Army:0 "Reconstitute the Army"
GRE_Reconstitute_Army_desc:0 "The Hellenic Army consists solely of the Security Battalions, a militia group established 15 years ago. Despite being effective in the past, they have far outweighed their usefulness, and thus if we seek to make our army a force to be reckoned with, we must introduce more professional elements to the Army. Without a professional force in our hands, we are sure to crumble against any powerful threat."
GRE_Infantry_Divisions:0 "Infantry Divisions"
GRE_Infantry_Divisions_desc:0 "The basic infantryman may not be the most gallant or well publicised part of an army, but inevitably they will comprise a large portion of one's forces. Focusing our efforts on developing better armaments and more powerful formations will yield great results."
GRE_Cavalry_Divisions:0 "Cavalry Divisions"
GRE_Cavalry_Divisions_desc:0 "Greece has been famed for its cavalry tactics since ancient times, and there is no reason to change that. A focus on cavalry tactics and armament will serve us well to outmanoeuvre any foes attempting to fight us and allow the execution of plans with speed and sharpness."
GRE_Mountaineers:0 "Mountaineers"
GRE_Mountaineers_desc:0 "Mountaineers are the logical next step up from our infantry developments. With Greece being a hilly and mountainous terrain, having specialised divisions and regiments specifically for fighting in these areas is the obvious and best route to take."
GRE_Armoured_Divisions:0 "Armoured Divisions"
GRE_Armoured_Divisions_desc:0 "Cavalry is excellent for speed, but lacks defensiveness against the modern weaponry arrayed before us. In order to deal with this issue, developing advanced tanks and other armoured forces will allow us to keep the speed and power of cavalry with the protection of steel."
GRE_Meet_Rebels:0 "Meet the Rebels"
GRE_Meet_Rebels_desc:0 "Despite their incredibly relentless guerilla campaign against us, the Greek rebels undeniably have powerful weaponry and a sizable manpower base. We must meet with them and concede what we must to gain their support or disarm them in some way; only then we will be able to fight."
GRE_Pact_Varkiza:0 "The Pact of Varkiza"
GRE_Pact_Varkiza_desc:0 "The Greek rebels are sorted into two main sets; the Left and the Right. Both factions are quite powerful, and although siding together against us, they do not have the most favourable relations with each other. Let us pick one of them to align with, and together we can crush the opposition."
GRE_Arm_Left_Wing:0 "Arm the Left-wing"
GRE_Arm_Left_Wing_desc:0 "Aligning with the leftist Communist forces may seem abhorrent, but they are the most adept fighters in the entire Resistance. They are excellently trained and have gained knowledge from Yugoslav Partisans across the years. We would gain a great boon by having them on the side of the State."
GRE_Arm_Right_Wing:0 "Arm the Right-wing"
GRE_Arm_Right_Wing_desc:0 "The right wing Monarchists and Republicans may not be as powerful or dominant as the Communists on the left, but they are more trustworthy. After all, what use is a strong force if we must fear betrayal at any time? With effort, it is perfectly feasible to forge them into a contingent of troops as powerful as the Communists, yet more loyal to us than the left could ever be."
GRE_Grand_Battleplan:0 "Our Own Style of Warfare"
GRE_Grand_Battleplan_desc:0 "Through cooperation with the Greek Resistance and active fighting against the opposition, the Greek Army has developed a new style of warfare that is distinctly Greek. We must apply what we have learned in order to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the Hellenic Army, against anyone who seeks to invade our beautiful land."

GRE_Hellenic_Navy:0 "The Hellenic Navy"
GRE_Hellenic_Navy_desc:0 "As of now, the Hellenic Navy is nonexistent in the waters. Despite existing as an organization under the umbrella of the Hellenic Armed Forces, it has no armed ships, barely any staff, and is essentially irrelevant. We must change this if we are to defend our lands; the Aegean is our connection to the outside world."
GRE_Conscript_Merchant_Marine:0 "Conscript Merchant Ships"
GRE_Conscript_Merchant_Marine_desc:0 "Despite the fact that the Hellenic Navy has no true military ships, Greece still has a fairly sizable merchant navy. We must seize the most up to date ships in order to begin the revival of the fleet. They are not as good as dedicated vessels, but they are ships, and will provide a passable start to creating a new squadron."
GRE_Spare_Italian_Ships:0 "Spare Italian Ships"
GRE_Spare_Italian_Ships_desc:0 "The Italian Regia Marina is one of the foremost navies in the world, with excellent ships and a sizable number of vessels at their disposal. Several of their ships are effectively unused, inadequate for the grand Mediterranean journeys their squadrons must take on. Thus, we shall purchase these ships, as they are perfectly adequate for the Aegean. It is expected that the Italians would be more than happy to oblige us."
GRE_Indigenous_Destroyers:0 "Indigenous Destroyers"
GRE_Indigenous_Destroyers_desc:0 "The Italian and converted merchant ships are suitable for the Hellenic Navy, but if we are truly to expand our forces in the sea, we must create our own designs, specialised for the tasks they are expected to accomplish and the foes they are expected to encounter in their expeditions across the sea. A majority of our fleet shall comprise of destroyers, as they are able, multi-purpose vessels; thus, development will begin at once on new Hellenic designs."
GRE_Indigenous_Submarines:0 "Indigenous Submarines"
GRE_Indigenous_Submarines_desc:0 "With overseas shipping being necessary if an enemy power attempts to invade our shores, the development of Hellenic submarines is a clear step forward in our naval forces. Submarines are also quick and cheap to produce, which will serve us much better than large and expensive capital ships in our dockyards."
GRE_Defenders_Aegean:0 "Defenders of the Aegean"
GRE_Defenders_Aegean_desc:0 "With the Hellenic navy in full recovery, we are suitably poised to control the Aegean and repulse any invader attempting to cross it. Although our fleet may not be the grandest or the largest, it is glorious, and glorious will the Hellenic State be."

GRE_Hellenic_Air_Force:0 "The Hellenic Air Force"
GRE_Hellenic_Air_Force_desc:0 "The recent wars in Europe and Asia have shown, more than almost anything else, that air power is a key to victory. Whether it's the use of concentrated close air support through the German blitzkrieg, or the broad strategic bombing championed by the Americans against Japan, control of the skies has given a great advantage in military power. If we are to be capable in battle, we must have an effective air force."
GRE_Restore_Air_Force:0 "Restore the Air Force"
GRE_Restore_Air_Force_desc:0 "Greece's Air Force was mostly destroyed during the war against the Axis that ultimately ended in defeat, and in the decade since them, we have been unable to rebuild it. However, as tensions rise in Europe, we may once again be thrust into war, and it is imperative that our air force is rebuilt to face whatever threat could come. The choice, then, is from which country do we source our planes?"
GRE_Italian_Planes:0 "Italian Planes"
GRE_Italian_Planes_desc:0 "Our old enemies, the Italians, have become our ‘protectors' and overlords. While we may secretly regret their domination of our country, the fact is that our military is integrated with theirs. It therefore only makes sense to look towards Italy for new designs."
GRE_Spanish_Planes:0 "Spanish Planes"
GRE_Spanish_Planes_desc:0 "Spain may not have fought in the major European wars, but the Spanish armed forces gained significant experience of modern warfare during the Spanish Civil War. While they are not a great power like Germany or Italy, it may help us to create closer ties with another European nation. We should source our planes from Spain."
GRE_German_Planes:0 "German Planes"
GRE_German_Planes_desc:0 "The Germans are the great champions of air warfare in Europe. Their spectacular use of air power during the ‘blitzkriegs' stunned the world and won them incredible victories, while the military record of Italy is not quite so grand. It is clear we should look towards the Germans for our aircraft."
GRE_Aegean_Airbases:0 "Aegean Airbases"
GRE_Aegean_Airbases_desc:0 "The Aegean islands are our great ‘unsinkable aircraft carriers' in the sea, defending against possible amphibious attack or naval threat. As a result, we should establish a strong network of air bases on these islands and on the Aegean coastline so we can establish air superiority over the region in case of conflict."
GRE_New_Fighter_Designs:0 "New Fighter Designs"
GRE_New_Fighter_Designs_desc:0 "One of the main focuses of our new air force should obviously be the defence of our nation's airspace. Wars of recent times have demonstrated the importance of air superiority, both to defend a country's own ground forces from enemy bombing, and to attack enemy forces safely from the air. As a result, we must prioritise the development and use of new fighter designs for the jet age, to maintain our ability to secure the skies."
GRE_Naval_Bombers:0 "Naval Bombers"
GRE_Naval_Bombers_desc:0 "Greece is a historically maritime nation, with long coastlines and thousands of islands. As a result, the defence of our seas will always be a major objective of our air force. We should make sure to develop and build a fleet of naval bombers that can intercept and destroy enemy naval forces that stray into our waters."
GRE_Medium_Bombers:0 "Medium Bombers"
GRE_Medium_Bombers_desc:0 "While the enormous fleets of thousands of heavy strategic bombers that countries like the United States bring to bear are likely out of our reach, we can nonetheless focus on smaller, medium bombers. As the Germans have showed, concentrated use of small and medium bombers can still pack a punch, and attacking enemy forces and supply lines from the air can make all the difference in battle."

Coming from a poor family from Thessaly, Plastiras saw that only an Army carreer would help him escape poverty.\n\n  In 1912 after graduating as an officer he became involved in the Balkan Wars where his courage and dedication earned him the nickname 'the Black Rider' in reference to his dark skin. He became involved in politics by supporting the Liberal Eleftherios Venizelos and fought in WW1. After the end of the Great War Plastiras was sent to Ukraine in support of the Whites in Russia, which was doomed from the beginning, and ultimately was sent to Asia Minor to fight the Turks. He became renowned as a great officer and managed to several thousand of Greeks from the advancing Armies.\n\n  After the complete and utter failure of the Asia Minor Campaign Plastiras aided by many fellow Liberal officers made a coup d'etat against King Constantine I and during that period he confronted Mussolini in the Corfu incident. Eventually Plastiras became perhaps one of the few military officers worldwide to give up power and proclaim elections.\n\n  Plastiras after that point lived in Greece and then in France uninvolved with politics. He would however fleed to Egypt following the occupation of France and from there to Cyprus.
