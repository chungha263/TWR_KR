 ##Events
 twrddr.1.t:0 "Krupp und Krause"
 twrddr.1.d:0 "Throughout the bars and pubs of Germany, a common song is heard from the working class: The tale of Krupp und Krause. The song talks about the exploitation of Krause, a simple industrial worker by his boss Krupp, a monopolist industrialist. The lyrics go on about the different paths the two characters go, with Krupp exploiting the value of Krause's work while he is only paid 5 Marks. The song ends with Krause getting laid off while Krupp continues to gain his riches. Through Krupp and Krause, the song is used by the workers as a protest against the capitalist system of our country and its exploitation of the workers, calling for the establishment of a true worker's state."
 twrddr.1.a:0 "Wir sind alle Krause!"
 twrddr.2.t:0 "FDJ Attempts Coup!"
 twrddr.2.d:0 "The youth of Germany has had enough of Marshall's Stoph iron fisted rule and has taken to the streets of Berlin against it! Thousands of young men, women and children have gone out to the streets bearing the german tricolour, demanding the end of Stoph's dictatorship. While we could handle the protestors at start, our worse fear became a reality. The Pionierpanzerbrigade has joined the protestors and its tanks are aimed towards us! Many soldiers are unwilling to fire upon children and we are one step before the downfall of our rule. What we decide to do will effect our nation drastically... "
 twrddr.2.a:0 "Resigning is the only solution."
 twrddr.2.b:0 "Open fire upon those bloody brats!"
 twrddr.3.t:0 "Strasser Leaves For Germany!"
 twrddr.3.d:0 "Otto Strasser, the disgraced leader of the Nazi Party's left wing has left Canada after years of living in exile. Originally arriving in 1941 as the "Prisoner of Ottawa", he moved to rural Nova Scotia and worked mainly as a ghostwriter for various newspapers on the inner workings of the Nazi regime. With the collapse of the Nazi regime and the establishment of People's Germany, Strasser has announced that he will return to Berlin immediately to "eradicate the privatist stench left behind by Hiterlite capitalists". Getting on a plane to Berlin to media fanfare, Otto thanked the people of Canada for "taking him in when Hitler's goons had poisoned his beloved Germany"."
 twrddr.3.a:0 "Bon Voyage, Herr Strasser!"
 twrddr.4.t:0 "Otto Strasser Returns"
 twrddr.4.d:0 "When the first international flights between Germany and the West was established, few expected one of its passenger to be the exile nationalist politician - Otto Strasser.\n\nArriving with his defunct passport, Otto Strasser declared his intentions to return home. Immigration Officers recognized Strasser and alerted the state department, where Otto Strasser was granted an audience with a minister. While Strasser can easily be denied entry for his old ties with the Nazi Movement, his recent actions have revolved around Anti-Nazi resistance and strong opposition towards the Nazi regime.\n\nIn many ways, Otto Strasser can be treated as a fellow rebel against the old tyranny, but his influence might slip Germany into an age of nationalism once again. What should we do?"
 twrddr.4.a:0 "Let him in."
 twrddr.4.b:0 "Entry denied."
 twrddr.5.t:0 "Strasser Returns to Germany"
 twrddr.5.d:0 "After decades of exile, Otto Strasser has been allowed entry back into his homeland - Germany. News spreaded upon his return, springing many of his hidden domestic supporters into greeting him at his new residency.\n\nBeing a critic of the Hitlerist Regime since his exile, Otto Strasser became somewhat of a rising star in the Canadian media, publishing a number of books on his insights while advocating for Germany's 'silent resistance against Hitler'. Now, finally back at home, Otto Strasser reportedly showed interest in restarting his political career in the New Germany, though his future actions are currently unknown."
 twrddr.5.a:0 "Oh, Strasser."
 twrddr.6.t:0 "The People's Revolution"
 twrddr.6.d:0 "Extract from the People's Manifesto, Volkskommando Headquarters. \n\nSoldiers of the Revolution! Long have we suffered under the boot of Fascist oppression: long have we watched the black-talons of the Swastika swoop away the innocent in its clutches, in Germania and across Europe, and long have we been helpless to stop it. Never again! As the abomination that called itself a Reich crumbles to radicals and hardliners, we in Germania-Welthauptstadt are called to a duty far higher and more desperate than mere conquest. \n\nOur task is one of redemption, of the nation itself and of its people. \n\nOf the Nation there is no need to elaborate; one need only look outside one's windows to watch the Empire of a Thousand Years set Germany itself aflame. Behold the fruit of Fascism! Widows weep over their husbands, brothers clutch the severed arms of sisters, father fights son and daughter murders mother - this is the golden future, this the final victory! If we are to die to the last man to save Germany from the monsters who feast on its innards as the buzzards swoop in, then that must be our duty as well.  \n\nSo, then, we must destroy those who surround us, Orthodox and Militarists alike, and swoop through the broken nation - cleansing our sin wherever we march. The task of the redemption of the People, however, will be a far more difficult matter, and it is one that must be discussed in later detail. Even so, this should only hasten us - for the liberation of the Nation is the prerequisite, and the purgation of our horrendous crimes the effect..."
 twrddr.6.a:0 "For Germany! For the People!"
 twrddr.7.t:0 "By The People"
 twrddr.7.d:0 "Twenty years. The German people have lived under the Nazi jackboot for over twenty years. During this period the people have lived through unimaginable pain. As millions of Germans had become entranced under Adolf Hitler's siren call of revanche and national reclamation, the infamous Gestapo had imprisoned thousands of innocents simply for voicing an idea contradictory to the Nazi party line. The people may have appeared complacent as our brothers and sisters gave their lives to fight pointless wars in France and Russia, but the fire of self-determination was never truly extinguished. We have bided our time as the Reich enslaved and butchered millions in the twisted vision of lebensraum, and as their hopeless mission brought economic ruin to Germany. Hitler's death and the subsequent civil war gave the true authority of Germany the chance to end what had started all those years ago in an obscure Munich beer hall. For the first time since 1932, the German people are once again the drivers of out great nation's destiny."
 twrddr.7.a:0 "Sing it from the rooftops, the Nazi bandits are dead!"
 twrddr.8.t:0 "For The People"
 twrddr.8.d:0 "Extract from the People's Manifesto, Volkskommando Headquarters. \n\n...we have every confidence, therefore, in the fighting zeal of the warriors who will bring Revolution to Germany. What we must now build is the infrastructure that will support them: who will make the rifle for the infantryman? Who will pay for his bullets, his food, and his medical supplies? And how are we, in the isolated city that was once the capital of human evil, to carry on making these items without starving ourselves? The solution is simple, from a Marxist standpoint: the will of the people produced our Revolution, and through precise, scientific application it can be made to sustain it. \n\nWe must develop a means of allocating scarce resources and human labor to sustain the war effort - optimization has worked well for all proletarian regimes, and without the former none of the latter have survived. A rudimentary role system using city records (which have survived the expulsion intact) will be more than sufficient to create a specialized labor force to man food production zones and armament factories. Next is the task of optimizing our labor force. We must attempt to foster a Revolutionary Consciousness in the people. Constant militarization will be necessary: the people's war will be fought bullet by mass-produced bullet, and we will ensure that the constant struggle of the soldier will penetrate the mind of the worker as well. \n\nWhere all this proves insufficient, of course, there is the matter of Revolutionary Purgation; here I will not presume authority I do not have, but Comrade [REDACTED] has already written concerning the [REDACTED] of 40 laborers suspected of [REDACTED] in a public area. Where the people forget their duty to the National Liberation, we will remind them; and if a few people do not survive the awakening, well, that is the nature of war..."
 twrddr.8.a:0 "War is shaped by the fighters."
 twrddr.9.t:0 "New Life Theory"
 twrddr.9.d:0 "The atrium of the prestigious University of Munich was abuzz with hushed whispers and nervous mutterings as the students awaited the day's speaker. Many faculty and staff looked especially nervous, it was no secret that their university had been openly complicite with the Nazi regime in the years prior. \n\nUpon the stage, flanked with the Schwarz-Rot-Gold flag, were three portraits. The first was of Florian Geyer, a knight who laid down his titles to fight for the common man during the German Peasants War of 1524. The second was of Robert Blum, member of the Frankfurt Parliament and critic of antisemitism who was executed for his role in the 1848 German Democratic Revolution. \n\nLast was a dual portrait of Sophie and Hans Scholl, who everyone in the atrium was very familiar with. The two had visited the university one day to distribute anti-Nazi leaflets, an action that would see their eventual execution by the party. The atrium the students and staff sat in was the very same the two youths had scattered their leaflates in on that fateful night. It was incredibly clear why the University of Munich was chosen for this event. Just about every staff member in attendance felt ill. \n\nAfter a brief applause, Eugen Grimminger took the podium and began to address the crowd. While the students listened dutifully, the faculty and staff couldn't focus on anything but the portraits. Geyer, Blum, Scholl. Grimminger spoke of the "New Life Theory", the new Germania, clean of authoritarianism. But the staff did not listen. Geyer, Blum, Scholl. Martyrs to tyranny in Germany. \n\nIt became very clear to the faculty of the University of Munich what exactly this New Life was all about. It was a New Life without them."
 twrddr.9.a:0 "The students explode into applause at the conclusion of the speech."
 twrddr.10.t:0 "Free Germany"
 twrddr.10.d:0 "The day before the Revolution, Elias had joked to his wife that there would be no real change whether the Volkskommando took power in Germania or not. She'd looked at him like he had sprouted a chicken's beak and begun to cluck, and shook her head. But Elias had believed it, and he explained it, too. "I simply don't believe they won't crack down on us for, you know, that." He gestured to the pamphlets lying on their table. Unread, unused, unopened even, but they'd been their quiet little labor of love for the last two years. "There's a war on, and all that. We're probably not that important." \n\nAmelia had simply chuckled. "My love, you must have faith. These Volkskommando fellows will be different, I can feel it..." \n\nThen the Revolution came, and there was no time left to speculate. Gunfire had swept past his home in volleys as the couple cowered, and there had been a couple of heady days when no one had known if the People would triumph over the Army. But there came a morning when the smoke cleared, and the carcasses of tanks stopped burning, and the gunfire had at last receded from earshot. \n\nAnd on that day, as Elias gingerly made his way into the suburbs, pamphlets in hand, he was stopped by a soldier, bearing the insignia of the Volkskommando. Flinching, Elias pulled back, and like dandelion blossoms set adrift by the wind the pamphlets flew from his hand. THE TRUTH ABOUT WAR, they read. PACIFISM IN GERMANY TODAY! THE JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES AND THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST TYRANNY! \n\nElias waited for the bullet, but it did not come. He waited, too, for the handcuffs, but none were in evidence. Instead the soldier smiled, winked and began to pick the scattered leaflets up, one by one, handing the pile over to Elias when he was done. "We're all fighting for something. I hope your war goes well, too." And the soldier walked down the streets, leaving Elias staring behind him."
 twrddr.10.a:0 "A new Germany is being born here."
 twrddr.11.t:0 "Call to Arms!"
 twrddr.11.d:0 "Blood and soil once promised to the germans in nigh every bombastic speech were now intermingled. As the accursed Führer wa slowly being consumed by maggots, gallons over gallons of blood seeped deep into german soil, and with every further uprising across Europe the promises of the Nazis became more and more vacant. With the main contenders at each other throats but unable to squash the others windpipes, the thousand year Reich seemed to be one of a couple decades at best. With the Nazis grip on even their own land slipping it was only natural that those who had waited and hid in the shadows for so long, hunted by the double lightning, send to the camps in the thousands were making their move. And so in the far east of Germany, they succeeded. It was a slow process, one day supplies did not arrive, then a high ranking officer vanished or was found dead, then entire battalions, then those remaining found themselves suddenly surrounded with thousands of those they had sought long purged from their lands: liberals, conservatives, social democrats, communists.\n"And truly long we have waited, endured, bled. As we saw our friends and comrades rounded up, savagely beaten, tortured and even experimented on. We fled and hid in the attics, the darkest corners of this already nightmarish land, but with every one of those lost, be it to the camps, Gestapo torture chambers or even wiped from memory altogether, we did not falter. Some of us fought for decades, some hid, some helped the former two or even the Jews that still remain." - the nameless council member addressed the surrounding crowd. "In the grand scheme of things, our names matter not, even I myself am rightfully without name for only my words matter, as this scene is repeating itself in every major town and village here - and soon all of Germany! Our names may be unknown but our deeds were and will be immortal, even those that just hid are of equal worth as those who fought and supplied. For you are here now, you are here as we destroy the Nazi menace forever. We may be considered monster now, but through our deeds, no every germa's deeds, that takes up arms against the monsters that lorded over Europe for so long, the name of our land and its people shall be redeemed!""
 twrddr.11.a:0 "Sound the voice of revolution!"
 twrddr.12.t:0 "A Call to Arms"
 twrddr.12.d:0 "Amidst the chaos of the German Inferno, hope has blossomed in impossible places: the capital of the nightmare Reich has been lost to what some are calling the Idealist Revolution. Members of the mysterious Volkskommando have proclaimed the formation of a People's Germany in Germania, aimed at the liberation of the whole of the nation and the restoration of a non-fascist system of government.\n\nThe Revolution faces a daunting uphill struggle in its task, being outnumbered and confined to the City, but the zeal of its soldiers and the sincerity of its beliefs is indubitable. As Germany continues to burn, the hopes of the world go with this unlikely challenger - hopes for peace, and perhaps for true freedom, too."
 twrddr.12.a:0 "We will see."
 twrddr.13.t:0 "The Reconstruction Committee"
 twrddr.13.d:0 "In the eyes of the transitional government, the regime's primary task is to restore democracy to Germany. However, multiple factors have led to the formation of the Reconstruction Committee. With the goal of eventually bringing democracy to Germany, the Reconstruction Committee has suggested that the current political atmosphere in immediate post-revolutionary Germany is \"nonoptimal\" for a multi-party system, subsequently announcing the delay of all planned general elections to allow a period of reconstruction. In this period, the revolutionary government will act provisionally, acting with the approval of the Reconstruction Committee."
 twrddr.13.a:0 "Germany needs guidance..."
 twrddr.14.t:0 "Leftist Landslide in Elections"
 twrddr.14.d:0 "In a series of local communal elections, independent leftist candidates have secured decisive victories across the different local councils and townships. While some might argue that the voters might have been \"encouraged\" to elect leftists, any major voices against the election have been viewed as opponents to the people's will, a threat to German liberties and seeking to undermine the newly formed local democratic systems."
 twrddr.14.a:0 "Power to the people!" 
 twrddr.15.t:0 "The End of Prussia"
 twrddr.15.d:0 "The unifier of Germany and the birthplace of many militaristic legends, the Free State of Prussia has turned into a husk of its former self under the hands of the Nazi regime. A name that has been associated with the tyrannical rule of the Nazis, the place that has been corrupted to the point of no return.\n\nPrussia must be abolished, it must be divided into multiple administrative divisions for better management and representation. With this act, a chapter of history finally ends, with the memory of Prussia being a thing of the past."
 twrddr.15.a:0 "Prussia must be destroyed."
 twrddr.16.t:0 "The Unexpected Partner"
 twrddr.16.d:0 "Immediately after his return from Canada, Otto Strasser has rededicated himself into the ring of politics. Strasser successfully ran for a council position in Bavaria, branding himself as a \"German Leftist\", introducing rural populations to his very own flavour of socialism.\n\nThis political movement has gained notable momentum in multiple rural regions. The Central Government and the Committee has noticed the usefulness of this movement, which could be used to swing former Nazi extremists into supporting the government's future decisionmaking."
 twrddr.16.a:0 "Strasser should work for us!"
 twrddr.16.b:0 "We will not let him grow stronger!"
 twrddr.17.t:0 "The German Congress Begins"
 twrddr.17.d:0 "Organized by the state-party apparatus, the First German National People's Congress is the post-revolutionary Germany's first major political event. However, this is far from a Western-style liberal election, the normal day citizenry is not able to participate, instead, representatives of their respective communities will attend the National People's Congress and act on their behalf.\n\nIn the first congress, the coalition will elect a new leader and decide on different policies that would determine the future of Germany."
 twrddr.17.a:0 "Let the congress begins!"
 twrddr.17.b:0 "A new red state..."
 twrddr.18.t:0 "Berlin Promise"
 twrddr.18.d:0 "The young revolutionaries of Germany have realized their true calling. As the Volksfront stabilized the regime, a promise has been made from the heart of Berlin.\n\nThe ruling coalition has deemed that their initial objectives have been completed, and that Germany must now rebuild itself under a democratic system. While the leading coalition still wish to serve the people, they must now seek the people's approval before making decisions on the their behalf. Germany must be democratic, the most important step before actual reconstruction could begin."
 twrddr.18.a:0 "This is the people's will!"
 twrddr.19.t:0 "Bundesrat Upset"
 twrddr.19.d:0 "While we expected that these sweeping reforms would capture the public's loyalty to the Volksfront, the election results of the Bundesrat has proved otherwise. It seems that many have been attracted by local liberals, conservatives or other forms of leftist parties, greatly weakening the leading coalition's approval and power.\n\nRegardless of these setbacks, the government must not challenge the people's voice."

However, this party has made some efforts in distancing themselves from Nazism, choosing to respect the revolution and declared their willingness to collaborate with the Democratic Party in the future.\n\nHowever, the Reichspartei (RP) is a drastically different party.

 twrddr.43.a:0 "Another nation reborn!"
 twrddr.44.t:0 "Austrian Autonomy"
 twrddr.44.d:0 "Due to Austria's status as one of Nazi Germany's earliest expansion target, the German Government have deemed that the Austrians deserve greater autonomy under the German nation.\n\nUnder the terms of Austrian Autonomy, large German military formations are prohibited from entering Austria, Austrian local government has greater control over its resources and the Austrians are entitled to hold independence referendums in the future. But for now, the Austrians are satisfied with current conditions."

 twrddr.48.t:0 "Austrian Sister Republic"
 twrddr.48.d:0 "As part of Germany's reconstruction plans, the Austrian region have been given autonomous status.\n\nWhile Austria now possess its own government, its lack of control means in reality, Austria has been reformed into a satellite of Germany, stuck in a limbo of German influence and an independent entity. While this might be unsatisfactory for the Austrian nationalists, the formation of this new system of sister republics is largely due to economic concerns, as the burden on Germany is now shared by the Austrian government."

Therefore, under overwhelming support of the government, the city of Germania has been renamed back to its original name of Berlin.

He was lost in the reading of different dossiers, letters, surveillance photographs, and all of the other components of the massive conspiracy that was revealing itself before his eyes. The people of Germany had shaken off the Nazi yoke, but even a cockroach can survive an atomic blast.\n\nAs the links were attaching themselves in his mind, Mielke could only give off an expression of absolute horror. He could only communicate his realization, and his fear, through the methods of voicelessness. He had in front of him tangible proof that there were Nazis working among the new revolutionary people's government, and that they were hell bent on  restoring the rule of the Aryan.\n\nThis had to be dealt with, swiftly and immediately."

As he approached, two other guards were dragging a haggard looking defendant out as he sobbed and begged for mercy. Otto felt a lump in his throat form. He silently prayed that he could plead his case. He wasn't a Nazi, he was forced to join the party. He was just the ambassador to Hungary for God's sake! He didn't even scheme during the war, he planned to swear that he would've stopped things if he could.\n\nOtto was brought before the stand. He peered up meekly at the judge, a young law student, flanked by two crimson banners. The judge spoke as powerfully as his youthful voice allowed him to.\n"Otto von Erdmannsdor..." the judge paused to shuffle through his unkempt stack of papers, looking for the man's file amongst them. Once the judge found the file, he continued to speak.\n\"During the war, you were ambassador to the Kingdom of Hungary, a co-belligerent in the Nazis criminal war. Is this true?\"\n\"Yes it is, but-\" Otto began to say before being interrupted.\"\n\"And after this appointment, you were assigned to the Foreign Office in which you worked under one Ernst Wörmann?\"\n"Yes, but I never-"\n\"For your implicit support and involvement in Nazi criminal actions, you are hereby sentence to death by hanging.\"\n\nThe gavel struck swiftly, and just like that Otto von Erdmannsdorff, in his mind innocent of all charges, was dragged off to the gallows.

Yet redemption still eluded him. The grand members of Hitler's clique and by that the faces of the National Socialist movement had slipped from his grasp so far. Under the hundred of thousands of soldiers captured there was no Albert Speer found yet, nor someone bearing Heinrich Himmler's visage. Some of the higher ups like Mannstein had been hunted down or identified, as Bundeswehr soldiers had searched through prisoners of war like Streicher.\n\nYet redemption was still not granted to him. How could the German people see that he had earnestly tried to fend off Hitler's madness, after realizing with what glee the man threw away the socialism in their name, if his inner circle of henchmen was not brought to justice? The devil himself lay long dead, desecrating his tomb would bring no good, too obvious the gesture of tearing down the past, too much positive sentiments still in the population. That madman Mielke wanted to torch it all, Thalheimer to bury his body at an undisclosed location but he had stopped them both.\n\nNo, redemption in the eyes of the populace would only come if the head of the snake was cut off, Speer, Goering, Goebbels. For now they had slipped through his fingers but sooner or later they would all be brought to the People's Court and then at last all Germans would know that he had always opposed Nazism with every fiber of his being, he had not joined the party if he had known what would become of it, only stayed to oust Hitler.\n\nAnd for those that still doubted that version of history...they'd be either swept away or dealt with accordingly.\n\nHe had waited so long what more were a couple years? He had a nation to mold in his image, true socialism conceived so long ago. After that perhaps tie up a few loose ends?"

It's ironic, then, that a new government in Germany, having toppled the Nazis, is working towards writing the wrongs of the past. It has long been theorised that economic prosperity and interdependence is the key to long-lasting peace, and as a result, and simply to boost economic growth, the Germans have led the creation of a European Trade Community, a group of nations aiming to allow free trade and economic cooperation between them.

Although we may not yet have much in the way of military power or political legitimacy, the very idea of this utopic new state will be sufficient to give us the latter, and to ensure a steady stream of volunteers to build up the former.

Organization of these two departments along the lines of marxist-lenninist theory should go a long way towards convincing the people of Germany that we really do intend to radically alter the system.

The civil war ruined a very large number of the buildings in the area we control, including a good many factories, mills, and chemical plants.

Already our theoreticians are crafting an entirely new theoretical basis for maintaining the Nation and for purifying our collective souls of the monstrosities of Nazism.\n\nWe have every intention of building a Germany repentant of its sins and willing to rebuild its moral foundations - for if we do not do so, our efforts at rebellion will be no more than murder upon murder."
 DDR_Free_Germany:0 "Free Germany"
 DDR_Free_Germany_desc:0 ""Imagine if you will, a Germany in which the boot does not stomp on the face of decent fellow citizens just because they believe that their work should be remunerated fairly. A Germany in which freedom of ideas, of labor, and of people, is the norm." \n\nSuch are the wise, if naive words which occupy the Social Democratic pamphlets distributed by that ideology's adherents within the People's German State. Such a promise of a free Germany, which we could comfortably integrate into our officially adopted revolutionary doctrines, makes for a very compelling argument amongst the liberal bourgeoisie of central Germany. Indeed, its adoption would cost us nothing and gain us the support of a good many people."
 DDR_For_The_People:0 "For the People"
 DDR_For_The_People_desc:0 "The People's revolutionary regime finds itself in what is quite possibly the worst position out of all in the German civil war. We are surrounded by enemies on all sides, have no support from the wehrmacht whatsoever, and no one is likely to compromise with us. This, however, is no reason to despair. Through the mobilization of our resources into an updated form of war communism, in which the proletariat is the central gear, we can both win the war and fulfill our raison d'etre: The transformation of Germany into a socialist country."
 DDR_Germania_Fortress:0 "Germania Fortress"
 DDR_Germania_Fortress_desc:0 "For all our efforts to create an effective military force, we cannot build Rome in a day. We can, however, build a bunker in a week and a foxhole in an hour. By constructing fortifications along critical sections of our frontline, we can give our armies a force multiplier that may prove the difference between the life and death of the revolution."
 DDR_The_Free_Agents:0 "The Free Agents"
 DDR_The_Free_Agents_desc:0 "Every good marxist knows that we in the People's German State are in agreement about respecting the freedoms of our citizens. Nevertheless, counter-revolutionary elements continue to threaten the viability of the country, something which cannot be allowed to continue. Consequently, we have decided to place a  special branch of the Volkspolizei under the direction of the Political Commision, so that it may have the authority to uproot all the reactionary elements which seek to end our crusade to free Germany from tyrannical nazi rule."
 DDR_Call_to_Arms:0 "Call to Arms"
 DDR_Call_to_Arms_desc:0 "At last, we have managed to forge our resources, industrial, military, and political, into a centralized state with serious chances of winning the civil war. It is therefore time to go on the offensive, an area in which we hold one very significant advantage over our competitors: The People are on our side. With a well established network to reproduce and spread the People's Propaganda, it will be possible for us to instigate uprisings in other areas of Germany, which should disorganize counter-revolutionary forces and weaken their front lines."
 DDR_Appeal_To_Moderates:0 "Appeal to Moderates"
 DDR_Appeal_To_Moderates_desc:0 ""Comrade... Fellow Germans: I know that many of you may be frightened by the nature of the word "revolution." This is an understandable feeling given the upheaval you have had to live through. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that by revolution, we merely mean the restoration of political and economic democracy. It would be ridiculous to say, as many of the national-sociliast have, that we intend to expropriate cafes, bars and small shops: Of course market elements can be allowed." \n\nAlthough it may pain us to say these things, the reality is that with much of the German middle class unlikely to support our full programme for revolution, we must make concessions in order to appeal to the politically moderate skilled workforce of the country."
 DDR_The_Volksheer:0 "The Volksheer"
 DDR_The_Volksheer_desc:0 "There are few trotskyites in revolutionary Germany, but their voice is heard very loudly in one issue: Military organization. They claim that, much like during the Russian revolution, we will be perpetually on the backfoot until we have organized and centralized armed forces. Their proposals for an aptly named people's army, and the accompanying Military Commision as part of our governing structure, has raised deep alarm in the right wing sectors of the revolution, particularly from Otto Strasser. Nevertheless, the troskyite's very detailed memorandum on how to coerce wehrmacht officers to lead our armies, develop our doctrine, and organize the disparate array of militias that defend the revolution, seems very appealing at a time when the war is developing not necessarily to our favor."
 DDR_Frauenbrigade:0 "Frauenbrigage"
 DDR_Frauenbrigade_desc:0 "What better example could the glorious Volksheer set to the world, and what better propaganda could it produce for us, than by raising all-female units. Although many of the wehrmacht officers we have pressed into service seriously oppose this idea, it is simply too good an opportunity to demonstrate our egalitarian principles, and beef up our manpow... military workforce while we are at it."
 DDR_Germany_Needs_Guiding:0 "Germany Needs Guidance"
 DDR_Germany_Needs_Guiding_desc:0 "The Republic is newborn, and like all infants a firm hand is needed to ensure it is not strangled in its cradle. We are called to a greater calling: some might call our methods tyrannical, oppressive - even contemporaneous to our unlamented predecessors. But it is not for them to bear the burden we must now shoulder, and it is not for them to decide how to chart the course. \n\nFor this is true of all new nations: chaos, under the right circumstances, is only one mistake away."
 DDR_Revolutionary_Council:0 "The Proletariat Constitution"
 DDR_Revolutionary_Council_desc:0 "We must enshrine the principles of popular liberty and public rights, even if we have traded in Western-style liberalism for the capacity to do so. Our constitutional experts are already drafting a new Bill of Rights for the German people, guaranteeing their right to free speech and rights of labor. On paper, under the Banner of the People, there will be protection for everyone!\n\nBut, the government understands that reality can often be upsetting."
 DDR_Elections_For_State_Reps:0 "Embrace Council Democracy"
 DDR_Elections_For_State_Reps_desc:0 "Council-based systems were our primary means of legislation during the War, but from all accounts it has proved wildly popular amongst our electorate. We will push for local assemblies, including cities, towns and the rural areas, to send delegates to represent them at our highest levels of government, and with this body of delegates we will create policy that truly fits the people's needs.\n\nIt is said that Lenin once promised All Power to the Soviets, in faraway Russia - that dream shall now be realized in the birthplace of Marx himself."
 DDR_Empower_The_Council:0 "Partition of Prussia"
 DDR_Empower_The_Council_desc:0 "Prussia: birthplace of the First Reich and home of the Teutonic dream. But since the Nazi era, Prussia has become the hotbed for arrogant militarism, infested by a toxic form of nationalism. The power of this administrative region must be crippled, for it will become yet another tool for yet another fascist government.\n\nBy dividing Prussia into multiple administrative bodies, this would greatly limit the capacity of any future local governments that seek to undermine the central authority."
 DDR_Promise_Democracy:0 "Ban the Oppositions"
 DDR_Promise_Democracy_desc:0 "While we will tolerate restricted public speech and assembly freedoms, Germany is still far too vulnerable to foreign influence to create a viable opposition! Unfortunately, many of our support base have decided that 'freedom' is worth risking everything we have built, and their parties are now spreading like wildfire in our cities' youth. We must force these well-meaning fools out of power before they gain enough influence to hurt us - or worse, damage the Republic. \n\nOf course, we will entertain a certain degree of assimilation into our own political system. It is always better to embrace the enemy before you lose sight of him, after all."
 DDR_Two_Principles:0 "Two Principles"
 DDR_Two_Principles_desc:0 "Our Nation, now as ever, stands on a knife's edge: how shall we guard against the threat of factionalism while adopting the best practices of economic competition? To chart a middle course, the Two Principles Model shall enshrine stability and prosperity as the goal of any German regime worth its salt. \n\nOur security apparatus and our economic ministries will foster our movement towards a truly German freedom - and destroy those who would break it down from within."
 DDR_Outlaw_Nationalists:0 "Form the United Front"
 DDR_Outlaw_Nationalists_desc:0 "Unity, now and ever, is the watchword for what we will build here; the development of Germany comes above all other political concerns. Yet many in our coalition demand a clear platform to influence policy, so that we do not become a unitary dictatorship like those of our predecessors. Our solution? The United Front, a wide-tent coalition of reformists who are dedicated both to the birth of our new Republic and its protection from undue influences. \n\nIt is a shame that those who do not agree with our approach will not be invited, but that is how politics works, yes? There is, after all, no second prize."
 DDR_The_German_Politburo:0 "The German Politburo"
 DDR_The_German_Politburo_desc:0 "The establishment of a formal Politburo will officially bring an end to the Transition Period, creating a formal Legislative authority that will rule in place of the shaky and porous Government we have created. All policymaking will be vested in its Delegates and in the leadership that governs the Politburo - not for us the petty division of other so-called populists! \n\nWe are the voice of the people, after all. And we shall only ever speak in a single tone."
 DDR_Path_To_Democracy:0 "Germany Needs Democracy"
 DDR_Path_To_Democracy_desc:0 "What need have we of new tyrants to replace the old? No, it is time that the People's Voice be heard loud, clear and unhindered by the restraints of those who would presume to dictate terms to them! We will embrace democratic traditions, break forever the cage of Bismarck and build something that has never before been attempted in Germany. \n\nWe will build a functioning, democratic apparatus, and unlike Weimar before us, we fully intend to keep it."
 DDR_Redraft_Weimar_Constitution:0 "The Basic Law"
 DDR_Redraft_Weimar_Constitution_desc:0 "Our law will not define what the people can do - it will instead assume unlimited freedoms of press, free speech and assembly for all, only outlining cases where these will be restricted. Despite what many regimes would claim, the law is not an instrument for constructing a new society: it is simply an instrument through which basic moral decency can be upheld. \n\nWith this minimal laws policy, we can at last begin to build a society that does not strangle its citizens - from now on, the German people will breathe free."
 DDR_Prepare_An_Election:0 "Prepare an Election"
 DDR_Prepare_An_Election_desc:0 "As our governing coalition prepares to enter a fully functioning democratic system, all across Germany the party logos and rallies blossom like flowers in the midst of spring. We will embrace the enthusiasm sweeping through the German People for their first legitimate election in twenty-odd years, and through the mediated use of electoral commissions we will make sure that no Hitler will rules-lawyer his way into power this time. \n\nSoon the old German Dream will stir, and liberty rise anew from the earth; like hope it will spring eternal, and like passion it will never die so long as our people live free."
 DDR_Election_Deadline:0 "Restore the Länder"
 DDR_Election_Deadline_desc:0 "Quite frankly, if we were to conduct direct democracy in a country as large as our own, any government we produced would not be long for this world. To prevent en masse suicides in our future governments, we will develop a federal system based on the old Bundesländ system, wherein federal states will create parliaments of their own to determine local policymaking. \n\nMany have talked of making Germany a federation in the long run, where the Central Government will act essentially as a plurality-assembly, but that will lie far in the future..."
 DDR_Condem_Nazism:0 "Embrace the Local Councils"
 DDR_Condem_Nazism_desc:0 "As we embark on a new system of politics, we will take some time to enshrine the councils that made our Government successful at the local level - the city assemblies and town councils that supported us will be given privileged positions within the Bundesrat and elevated prominence at all levels of decisionmaking. They will also act as a direct medium between the Government and our people, bypassing the Federal system should the need arise. \n\nGlory to the Councils! As they lean, so too shall Germany!"
 DDR_Lift_Political_Bans:0 "Lift Political Bans"
 DDR_Lift_Political_Bans_desc:0 "It was once the policy of Germany to restrict freedom of speech, to confine discourse to an acceptable official line - no longer. It is time to embrace the freedom that makes truly great nations great, and the ending of bans on political parties will ensure that the next phase of German life will at least be one where it is free to voice your opinions. \n\nStrict clampdowns on the National Socialists are the only exception to this; we have not the stomach to tolerate fascism. Perhaps they can practice their 'freedoms' in South America?"
 DDR_Power_To_The_Bundesrat:0 "Power to the Bündesrat"
 DDR_Power_To_The_Bundesrat_desc:0 "The former Landtage councils of Germany were united in the form of the Staatsrat, a Weimar-era chamber of Parliament - our modern-day Bündesrat serves much of the same functions, and we will give it power to enact policymaking just like its federal-state components. Policymaking shifts to this Council will also be sanctioned by the devolution of central leadership privileges downwards. \n\nAfter all, single-man rule rarely turns well for Germany. We must be prepared to take a new approach, and fresh eyes, to break the grip of strongmen wherever it can be found."
 DDR_One_Principle:0 "One Principle"
 DDR_One_Principle_desc:0 "There are many pretty words we could arraign around our core values, and many school teachers have begun that little task, but the truth is this: we yearn only to bring Freedom to Germany, and we need no other distractions or alternatives. Freedom shall be our call in the race to DeNazification, and our fortress against the hammer-blow of reactionaries. \n\nNo matter what may come our way, we are committed. Only our deaths will threaten our resolve: Germany lives and dies free from external oppression, no matter what flag it wears."
 DDR_Proclaim_The_Federation:0 "Refined Parliamentary System"
 DDR_Proclaim_The_Federation_desc:0 "Building a Parliamentary system where a Reich once stood was never going to be easy. We will continue to change the composition and boundaries of our new federal Parliament and its constituent states, making them more demographically inclusive and broadening the scope of our policymaking on national-level matters. \n\nNothing could be more important than hearing our people, after all. And as we advance to a better democracy, that voice will be echoed ever louder..."
 DDR_Young_Germany:0 "Young Germany"
 DDR_Young_Germany_desc:0 "Although many thought it impossible, the German nation has been given a second chance. We now have the opportunity to develop democracy in Germany, and the excitement of this is having its effect on the popular consciousness. This is not the old Germany of the Kaiser or the Fuhrer, but the young Germany, of the people!"
 DDR_Militia_Shuffling:0 "Militia Shuffling"
 DDR_Militia_Shuffling_desc:0 "Our victory in the revolution was won through the blood of our militiamen. However, now that we are victorious it is imperative that we re-organize the militias into a proper army for Germany. This will ensure that factions and cliques do not develop within our military based on ideological or regional lines."
 DDR_Convert_Military_Industry:0 "Convert Military Industry"
 DDR_Convert_Military_Industry_desc:0 "Our industrial prowess has focused on one thing over the past twenty years: war. Now we must dismantle the economy based on plunder and war. Factories that used to produce panzers, troop transports, bombers shall be retooled to build tractors, trucks, and passenger aircraft."
 DDR_Surrender_Offensive_Rights:0 "Surrender Offensive Rights"
 DDR_Surrender_Offensive_Rights_desc:0 "Our nation's crimes against the people of the world will likely never be fully absolved. Yet we can ensure they are never repeated in the future by renouncing rights to offensive war. This shall be enshrined in our new constitution. By design, the German military shall never have the power to wage offensive war again."
 DDR_Scrapping_Military_Equipment:0 "Scrapping Military Equipment"
 DDR_Scrapping_Military_Equipment_desc:0 "For decades, we have toiled in factories, feeding the war machine. As we step back and rebuild our nation, only now can we truly grasp just how much time and energy we all wasted. We will try to retrofit what we can for civilian purposes; turning tanks into bulldozers and tractors, for example. We will scrap what cannot be easily converted, using their materials to build our future economy with. We shall beat our swords into ploughshares, and our spears into pruning hooks."
 DDR_Coalition_With_White_Roses:0 "Coalition with the White Rose"
 DDR_Coalition_With_White_Roses_desc:0 "The White Roses will make an ideal coalition partner. Their social democratic views are not that dissimilar from ours, and we have nothing but admiration for their efforts to topple the Nazi regime. While we disagree with their views on capitalism's ability to be transformed from the inside, the White Roses will definitely be a useful way for the German people to warm up to our viewpoints."
 DDR_Compromise_with_Moderates:0 "Compromise with Moderates"
 DDR_Compromise_with_Moderates_desc:0 "Politics in a democracy is the art of compromise. We cannot just ignore the liberals and Christian democrats. We need to look at the broader picture when establishing our government. We cannot just alienate good people who fought along our side, just because they hold different views on the exact path our new Germany should take."
 DDR_Austrian_Referendum:0 "Austrian Referendum"
 DDR_Austrian_Referendum_desc:0 "The Anschluss referendum of 1938 was of… dubious legitimacy, to say the least. The process was subject to massive state propaganda campaigns; the election was neither free, nor the ballots secret. We must settle this issue, once and for all. Austria deserves a second vote, this time one with no coercion involved. The Austrian people will always be our brothers, no matter what. However, it is their right to determine if they wish to take part in building this new Germany, to strike their own path in the world."
 DDR_Independent_Germany:0 "Independent Germany"
 DDR_Independent_Germany_desc:0 "Although aligning ourselves with the United States, Britain, and the rest of the Toronto Accord appeals to many, there are those who have expressed concerns or downright oppose the idea. The leftists in our coalition argue that Germany has no place cozying up to an alliance based on preserving liberal capitalist hegemony. Others, disagreeing for less ideological reasons, note that a Germany that's too closely tied to one faction or another will inevitably compromise our ability to adopt a foreign policy acting in our people's best interests."
 DDR_Open_Up_To_TA:0 "Open Up to TA"
 DDR_Open_Up_To_TA_desc:0 "For years, the Toronto Accord has stood as the world's bastion of liberty and democracy. These are the very foundational values we bled for in our revolution against Nazi tyranny. The best way to promote these values in our new foreign policy is to join a faction that shares our same values. We shall take concrete efforts to improve our relations with the United States, Britain, and other TA member states. Perhaps, one day, we might even be invited as a member."
 DDR_Encourage_Education:0 "Encourage Education"
 DDR_Encourage_Education_desc:0 "Ignorance is what led to the rise of radicalism, we must recognize our past faults by focusing on educating the people, ensuring that nobody will turn to Nazism anymore."
 DDR_Remembering_The_Resistance:0 "Remembering the Resistance"
 DDR_Remembering_The_Resistance_desc:0 "After our struggle for freedom against the tyrannical Nazi regime, we must remember the resistance movement, and constantly remind ourselves to not repeat Germany's past mistakes."
 DDR_Encourage_Pan_Europeanism:0 "Encourage Pan-Europeanism"
 DDR_Encourage_Pan_Europeanism_desc:0 "European integration is not a particularly new concept. Leaders starting in the 19th century began to see the value of integrating the nations of Europe. Now we have survived the darkest times in our history, we have a duty to ensure that wars never wreak destruction upon our continent again. We propose to begin this process by proposing the creation of pan-European institutions. Influential economists and some politicians have proposed pulling together the coal and steel industries in particular, as these resources are critical to national economies and militaries."
 DDR_The_Angel_Of_Democracy:0 "The Angel of Democracy"
 DDR_The_Angel_Of_Democracy_desc:0 "The basic failure which led us to the dark years of Nazism was the insufficiency of the Weimar republican system. If we are to ensure that there is never a Fourth Reich, we must bolster and strengthen our democratic institutions, for the good of Germany and the world."
 DDR_Cut_the_Army:0 "Cut the Army"
 DDR_Cut_the_Army_desc:0 "As we bring Germany into a new era of peace, prosperity, and cooperation with the world at large, there is no need for such a bloated military budget. The Kriegsmarine, Luftwaffe, and Wehrmacht have only been so ridiculously large because the entire nation has been on a war economy and using slave labor for the past two decades. This is not sustainable and the Nazis have only taken Germany this far because of the wholesale plunder of Eastern Europe. Quite obviously, we need a considerably smaller military than what we have been used to."
 DDR_Power_To_The_People:0 "Power to the People"
 DDR_Aid_European_Resistance:0 "Aid European Resistance"
 DDR_Aid_European_Resistance_desc:0 "Although we have triumphed against the Nazis at home, the oppression still lives on. Reichkommissars still reign over their petty fiefdoms in the east, refusing to loosen their ironclad grip. This revolution did not end with us. We will bring it East and avenge all those who have died in the name of lebensraum."
 DDR_Improve_Standards:0 "Improve Standards"
 DDR_Improve_Standards_desc:0 "As much as Goebbels tried convincing us otherwise, the average German never really saw the quality of his life improved much under Nazi rule. Our real standard of living is far lower than the propaganda figures have shown. The people must see their lives improve under our government."
 DDR_Focused_Development:0 "Focused Development"
 DDR_Focused_Development_desc:0 "We can't simply leave the German economy to its own devices after decades of mismanagement. Now that a democratic government has been firmly established, and our industrial might is finally being converted to civilian purposes, our government must enact measures to develop our economy in areas we are currently lagging behind compared to the West. We don't intend to bring Leninist five-year plans to Germany; we just want to use our state's power to support economic sectors that are essential to the nation, especially those that are unlikely to receive significant private investment."
 DDR_Labour_Reformation:0 "Labour Reform"
 DDR_Labour_Reformation_desc:0 "The Deutsche Arbeitsfront, German Labour Front, was a sham. We need true unions to represent the German worker. There was never any true labor unions in Nazi Germany. What we got was an organization placing the industrialists interests ahead of the workers, and all we got were some state funded vacations. It is time to bring back true, independent labor unions where the worker can express their grievances openly, and even strike if need be."
 DDR_Aid_The_Rurals:0 "Aid the Rurals"
 DDR_Aid_The_Rurals_desc:0 "One of the Nazi Party's largest bases of support was rural Germans. A growing urban/rural divide during the Weimar era made them feel ignored by the government leading them to turn to extremism. We need to ensure that living standards in the rural areas do not lag behind the rest of the nation. Not only does our party's political survival depend on this, but our nation's very own existence just may as well."
 DDR_Unity_Coalition:0 "Unity Coalition"
 DDR_Unity_Coalition_desc:0 "When you bring all parties into the fold as we set out to establish the People's German government. Now is not the time for petty bickering over minute policy details. We are here to actually build our country from the ground up, to secure freedom to a people who have been denied it for decades. Our first democratic government shall be a National Unity government. No one party will always get what they want, but these compromises are the sacrifices we must make for our nation."
 DDR_Moderate_Policies:0 "Moderate Policies"
 DDR_Moderate_Policies_desc:0 "Our revolution against Nazi tyranny would not have succeeded without cooperation extending across ideological lines. From hardline Marxists to Christian Democrats, all fought and died so the German people can be free from the crushing tyranny of the Nazi regime. We must ensure our policies do not push too far one way or the other."
 DDR_Remember_The_Children:0 "Remember the Children"
 DDR_Remember_The_Children_desc:0 "Millions of Germans were either too young to remember life before the Nazis, or were born after Hitler rose to power. For years, boys and girls were spoon-fed state propaganda and outright lies. Our entire education system must be overhauled. We need to repudiate the hatred and blind loyalty hypnotized into our children, and do everything we can to make sure the next generation will never think of life under Hitler as \"the good old days.\""
 DDR_Looking_Outwards:0 "Looking Outwards"
 DDR_Looking_Outwards_desc:0 "At last, some semblance of normality has returned to Germany. Now, we can finally begin the process of establishing our nation's foreign relations. We shall establish embassies, and exchange ambassadors with other nations around the world, doing our best to show how we are different from the monsters who preceded us. Some initial apprehension is to be expected, of course. Eventually, however, the German government will be seen as a committed democracy."
 DDR_Normalize_Relations:0 "Normalize Relations"
 DDR_Normalize_Relations_desc:0 "We need to create relations with the other democratic nations of Europe on an equal footing. Establishing diplomatic relations with the free nations of the world will show how Germany has truly changed. Additionally, it will strengthen us on the domestic front by further reaffirming that we are the legitimate German government."
 DDR_Internal_Affairs:0 "Internal Affairs"
 DDR_Internal_Affairs_desc:0 "People's Germany is not simply a movement anymore but an actual country. And now, we begin to move from dismantling the last remnants of Nazism, to aspects of civil administration. The Chancellor's agenda is slowly getting filled with the more mundane aspects of government. No one said debates over tax brackets or infrastructure would be sexy. However, it is relieving to know just how far we've come."
 DDR_Autonomus_Regions:0 "Autonomous Regions"
 DDR_Autonomus_Regions_desc:0 "Much to Hitler's chagrin, there still are large swathes of our nation still with large minority populations. As we strive to right the wrongs of the past decades and ensure that these atrocities never happen again, we must remember that we can just simply have a system of government where minority rights are repealed through majority vote. Autonomous regions are to be established in areas with significant populations of ethnic minorities, with greater control over education, language, and other cultural matters than compared to other federal states."
 DDR_Matter_Of_Austria:0 "Matter of Austria"
 DDR_Matter_Of_Austria_desc:0 "While the idea of uniting all German-speaking peoples into one Großdeutschland has been discussed since the 19th century, it only became a reality after the Anschluss of 1938. As a result, there is considerable debate over the status of Austria. Many in our government insist the German people are inseparable. Others argue that the idea of a united pan-Germanic nationstate has been forever tainted by the legacy of the Nazi regime, and suggest that an independent, allied Austria will make a useful buffer state."
 DDR_Free_Thinking_League:0 "Free Thinking League"
 DDR_Free_Thinking_League_desc:0 "Although we are steadfastly making our transition to democracy, many Germans are truly unfamiliar with the concept. This is particularly true among younger Germans. In order to combat this deficit, we will establish national Free Thinking Leagues across Germany, in order to popularly instill democratic values."
 DDR_Workers_Manifesto:0 "Workers Manifesto"
 DDR_Workers_Manifesto_desc:0 "The rise of the Nazis was fundamentally a question of bourgeois reaction and deep anti-communism. If Germany is to ever truly move on from the horrors of its past, the German worker must be put at the helm of national development. Fascism is the darkness of humanity, but socialism is the light."
 DDR_Learn_From_Stalin:0 "Learn from Stalin"
 DDR_Learn_From_Stalin_desc:0 "Although he was unable to defeat the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin provided a plan for socialist primitive acculimuation, and the rapid industrialization of a country. We should follow his example."
 DDR_Ideal_Economy:0 "Ideal Economy"
 DDR_Ideal_Economy_desc:0 "Now that the proletariat at the helm of the German economy, we can go force with the revitalization of our productive forces. No more will we rely on slavery, or the war machine, to bring us economic prosperity."
 DDR_Enlight_The_Population:0 "Enlighten the Population"
 DDR_Enlight_The_Population_desc:0 "Unfortunately many of our citizens, particularly our younger ones, have their minds tainted by the diseased ideology of Nazism. Through the institution of revolutionary education, we can begin the work of excising this mental scourge once and for all."
 DDR_Third_Way:0 "Third Way"
 DDR_Third_Way_desc:0 "We must reject both Nazism and bourgeois republicanism as enemies of the revolution. It was the inadequacies of the Weimar Republic which allowed the Nazis to seize power. Socialism represents the third and true path for the German worker and the German nation as a whole."
 DDR_Planned_Economy:0 "Planned Economy"
 DDR_Planned_Economy_desc:0 "The Nazis laid waste to German economic potential, with countless resources and people being used to murder Slavic people in the eastern colonies. Now that the German worker is in power, we can truly plan out our path of economic development. Barbarism will become a foreign concept in Germany!"
 DDR_Greater_Good:0 "Greater Good"
 DDR_Greater_Good_desc:0 "We have clawed out justice from the most wretched society the world has ever seen. We represent the antithesis of Nazism, and the world must be made aware of that. The German Workers' State stands for justice and progress everywhere in the world!"
 DDR_Balanced_Economics:0 "Balanced Economics"
 DDR_Balanced_Economics_desc:0 "The Nazi period was marred with a great deal of economic inequality. Even with the wealth stolen from the east, a small group of rich business men controlled the whole of the German economy. We must right this wrong, and expropriate this ill-gotten wealth."
 DDR_Acknownldge_The_Soviets:0 "Acknowledge the Soviet Union"
 DDR_Acknownldge_The_Soviets_desc:0 "The Soviet people took up the herculean task of establishing the world's first socialist state. They fought valiantly against the Nazi beast, but were ultimately defeated and turned into a rump state. As we work to bring socialism to the heart of the former fascist empire, we must keep the spirit of the Soviets in our minds and in our hearts."
 DDR_Aid_European_Workers:0 "Aid European Workers"
 DDR_Aid_European_Workers_desc:0 "All across the continent, European workers labour under the brutal exploitation of the bourgeoisie. Some workers even suffer under regimes which could only exist through German hegemony. It is our responsibility as the new core of European socialism to aid our comrades."
 DDR_Eastern_Europe_Surrender:0 "Surrender Eastern Europe"
 DDR_Eastern_Europe_Surrender_desc:0 "The central Nazi project was to displace and exterminate the peoples of eastern Europe, in order to settle that land with so-called pure Aryans and expand Germany's size. We cannot say that we have moved past Nazism if we still hold onto these claims. Eastern Europe will never again be German, and it never was."
 DDR_Collective_Guilt:0 "Collective Guilt"
 DDR_Collective_Guilt_desc:0 "Although many of us have fought long and valiantly against it, the German nation as a whole supported the murderous Nazi project. We have to recognize that fact, if we are to move forward as a nation. Our children must be taught about what happened and why it happened."
 DDR_Rehabilitation_Policy:0 "Rehabilitation Policy"
 DDR_Rehabilitation_Policy_desc:0 "Many of our citizens are still tried and true Nazis, and that is not a goof foundation for a socialist system. In order to bring these people into the light, we must institute a system of ideological rehabilitation for the worst of our compatriots."
 DDR_Republiks_Plan:0 "Republiks Plan"
 DDR_Republiks_Plan_desc:0 "In order to ensure that all of the different regions of Germany are given their due right to self-determination, we must institute the Federal Republiks system.

 DDR_Mixed_Economy_desc:0 "We aim to avoid the extremes of both cutthroat capitalism and centrally planned socialism. Our vision of socialism does not mean murdering the bourgeoisie, and installing a dictatorship of dogmatic Marxists. Socialism means liberating political and economic life from the control of an elite few, and the extension of democracy into the workplace. The commanding heights of the economy – infrastructure, natural resources, transport, and utilities – shall be dominated by state-owned enterprises. However, we will also promote and encourage worker-ownership of the rest, but leave small businesses and sole proprietorships relatively untouched."

 DDR_The_Council_Victorious:0 "The Council Victorious"
 DDR_The_Council_Victorious_desc:0 "At last after the treachery of the Social Democrats and Bolsheviks, truly democratic socialism reigns in Europe. No longer shall we delegate the democratic process to a single party that twists and corrupts the true communist spirit like the Bolsheviks, nor shall we surrender to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie that is liberal republicanism. No, we shall at last realize the grand vision Marx and Engels saw so long ago: after two millennia a true genuine democracy, by the people and for the people."

 DDR_Collectivise_the_Great_Estates_desc:0 "Since the time of the Junkers that dominated the Prussia and later the German Empire, the great estates have been firmly in the hands of the rich elite. Their domains sigil of their power. And so it continued under the Nazis, the Junkers became oligarchs and whilst the population lost all once the Nazi's "economy" faltered in their strongholds they grew even fatter. These will be the first to fall as we oust the slave masters."

 DDR_Seize_the_Means_of_Production_desc:0 "The capitalist mode of production whilst providing much prosperity and advancement for humanity and as Marx and Engels rightfully observed was duly necessary to escape the horrors of feudalism, is ultimately based upon exploitation and control of one over the many. And no amount of "reform" could change that, with the rise of Fascism amply showing where this tyranny leads. Alas the revolution has come and with it the workers shall be freed."

Selling out the revolution and workers in favor of bourgeois favor. Whilst they at least stood their ground in voting against the enabling act, neither we nor the workers of Germany shall ever forget where their true allegiance lies."
 DDR_Relief_the_Chairwoman:0 "Relief the Chairwoman"
 DDR_Relief_the_Chairwoman_desc:0 "Even with much of her positions initial power already relinquished to the councils, the Chairwoman still wakes in the night fearing the vice of tyrannic lust suddenly overcoming her upon seeing the hardships the German people still suffer. As such she has decreed to speed the transition to full council democracy even more: soon the last vestiges of the bourgeois on our democracy shall be fully flushed out."
 DDR_Strengthen_the_Councils:0 "Strengthen the Councils"
 DDR_Strengthen_the_Councils_desc:0 "The councils where every single voice can be heard are after millennia since the first seeds of western democracy blossomed in the end its only true expression: granting every man and woman an equal voice in the matters of politics and economics, unspoiled by corruption bourgeois or otherwise, as the „great" republics of the world sadly still are.

 DDR_Weaken_the_Parliament:0 "Weaken the Parliament"
 DDR_Weaken_the_Parliament_desc:0 "Whilst a venerable instrument in theory, coordinating the sometimes diverging interests of the cities and towns and channeling them into one, in practice this has often resulted in either local customs or grievances being swept aside or downright discarded in favor of tyranny from the central government, be it local or national. As such the parliaments shall largely serve an advisory and coordinative role, being only able to overrule a councils decision in most dire -and very well justified- need such as war."

 DDR_Discredit_Bourgeois_Feminism:0 "Discredit Bourgeois Values"
 DDR_Discredit_Bourgeois_Feminism_desc:0 "As comrade Lenin recognized, the new society we are creating will inevitable bear the scars of the old. As we seek to root out the National "Socialists", we must also realize the vestiges of the capitalist mode of production: those not just being the last of the businesses still in private hand, but also bourgeois culture. Their „values" propagated for decades, preaching selfishness and envy for all instead of everyone working for the good of all so that all can partake in the fruits of society."
 DDR_Monetary_Aid_for_Mothers:0 "Monetary Aid for Families"
 DDR_Monetary_Aid_for_Mothers_desc:0 "As comrade Stalin recognized, simply to have political and personal freedom on paper does not suffice to truly enjoy them. For how could a man working under an abusive boss every day just to feed his family claim he is truly free to act as he wills? As such we have to make sure that the fruits of society truly each each and everyone of our people can savor. This starts with bolstering the very foundation of it: the family and the children that will hopefully be born onto a better world, without the horrors of Nazism."

Long thought a pariah amongst our ranks as to his and his brothers membership in the NSDAP, their subsequent purging in 1933 and his brothers violent death were able to garner him tolerance and his tongue finally lordship over Germany..."

These laws were a groundbreaking milestone in Europe, causing them to be adopted by much of the continent. Now that we are to rebuild not just Germany but the whole continent we need a new set of Magdeburg rights: a set of laws that administer much the same areas as they did but are reformed for modern times. \n\nSo that even with the devastation still ongoing we can live in tranquility with our neighbor and our brother the Jew once again!"

Treacherously siding with the capitalist pigs and abandoning the good of the people for their petty shekels and riches they whored Germany and Europe out for long to their mercy. Now that a red flag is raised over Germany once more, we can finally rectify this issue: the first step in that will be to abolish private property. From thenceforth an individual may be only entitled to their personal belongings."

One of those is the guild system, organizing the workers along their specific crafts, whilst we already have sown the roots of it by federalizing the handicrafts, now we shall formally codify them and soon the perfection of a craft honed over an entire lifetime shall soon grace our land once more."

Courtesy of long having enemies on all sides and the unique conditions of the germanic lands, traditional western democracy could no prosper.

As such reconstruction of our glorious land need be not only a necessity but something done with utmost haste.

For which tribe could claim to not only have vanquished the almighty Romans but survived for centuries as not a singular nation but a fragmented pile of shambles, even braving the thirty year war. Yet starting with the Prussians and corrupted wholly under Goebbels, this spirit has been twisted into mindless militarism, seeing our defeat first in the first Great War then make us monsters eternal during the second. This corruption will need to be wholly flushed out."

With many seeking justice against us for the horrors wracked upon them and much of the international still looking at us in disgust the mountain ahead to climb is truly monumental.

Little by little Chairman Strasser and the Grand Council have etched away the shackles imposed upon us by the three foolish past regime and underneath the true Germanic soul was revealed again! The first half of the twentieth century may have been shrouded in darkness for our lands, but the second shall be one of pure and ancient light!"
