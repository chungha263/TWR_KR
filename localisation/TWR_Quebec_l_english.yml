QUE_Corporate_Dominance_desc:0 "Under the leadership of the Union Nationale, a vast majority of Quebec's resource sector is owned by private companies which pay virtually no taxes. If we are to ever have control over our economy, this issue must be addressed."

QUE_Political_Infighting_desc:0 "The coalition of politicians that brought independence to Quebec were from all across the political spectrum, and the only thing they could ever agree upon was Quebec's sovereignty.

#### Focuses ####

QUE_Le_Quebec_Libre:0 "Le Québec Libre!"
QUE_Le_Quebec_Libre_desc:0 "Finally, centuries of Anglo rule of our country has ended. People cheer in the streets as our great nation throws off the yoke of its age-old masters. Our nation enters a new dawn, one free from the influence of the Canadians. Though our future is unclear, it will surely be bright."
QUE_Provisional_Govt:0 "Forming the Provisional Government"
QUE_Provisional_Govt_desc:0 "Though Quebec is a free nation, we have yet to develop a government. We will become a democracy, that's a given, but we need to have stable elections to do that. And we can't have stable elections without a stable country. To that end, we will form a provisional government to deal with any problems that may arise before we can hold elections. This should hopefully keep the nation stable, or at least functional, in the meantime."
QUE_New_Army:0 "A New Army"
QUE_New_Army_desc:0 "While we have a new nation, it is meaningless if we can't defend ourselves. Already we are swamped with militia volunteers and swarms of disorganized paramilitaries seeking to defend Quebec from all those who would destroy it. We must organize these patriots into one unified army to properly defend Quebec from invaders. We're already putting up recruitment posters, urging Quebec's loyal sons to defend it to the death."
QUE_Dealing_With_Extremists:0 "Dealing With Extremists"
QUE_Dealing_With_Extremists_desc:0 "Many would like to see our fledgeling light of Quebecois democracy extinguish before it can truly blaze. These extremists are dangers to our new government, and must be dealt with as such. By deciding wether to ban extremist parties/groups such as Communists and Fascists from our government, we can successfully guarantee the survival of our young country from internal threats."
QUE_First_Elections:0 "Call for New Elections"
QUE_First_Elections_desc:0 "The time has come. Our young democracy will undergo its first elections. The future of Quebec will be determined here. Preparations are being made in the provisional government for a transition of power, and the people of Quebec watch and wait anxiously for the victors. Only time will tell the fate of our new nation…"

QUE_Pat_Victory:0 "Crediitistes Victory!"
QUE_Pat_Victory_desc:0 "It was the nationalist spirit of the Quebecois that led our nation to freedom: It is that same spirit that led the Parti créditiste to victory. With a platform of Social Credit, Catholic identity, and infamously, Anti-Semitism, Réal Caouette has emerged victorious in the first Quebecois elections. Under his leadership, Quebec shall be strong, equal, and free!"
QUE_Pat_Education:0 "Catholic Education"
QUE_Pat_Education_desc:0 "The identity of the Quebecois is intrinsically tied to the identity of Catholicism. The Catholic church is our guiding moral light, and what is the purpose of education if not to raise our children to be moral, intelligent adults? Henceforth, the church will have a far greater role in shaping the minds of our youths, and our schools shall become strictly Catholic in nature: Surely nothing harmful can come from priests spending extended periods of time with young boys, after all."
QUE_Pat_Spirit:0 "Traditionalist Spirit"
QUE_Pat_Spirit_desc:0 "Adherence to tradition does not conflict with advocating for progress. As we advance the nation of Quebec into a new, more perfect age, we must always remember our roots, and solidify the aspects that have always made our people strong: Catholicism, nationalism, and opposition to the Anglos!"
QUE_Pat_White_Berets:0 "Glory To The White Berets!"
QUE_Pat_White_Berets_desc:0 "The Pilgrims of St. Michaels, also known as the White Berets after their signature uniform, can be considered nothing short of the absolute height of morality and piety. What's more, they are absolutely dedicated to morally corrected capitalism with Catholic teachings, fully embracing Social Credit as a concept. These men should be praised for the noble heroes they are, and will serve as an excellent example of how the ideal Quebecois should live their life!"
QUE_Pat_AB:0 "A+B Theorem"
QUE_Pat_AB_desc:0 "Perhaps the most important aspect of the Social Credit economic system, the A+B Theorem states that, regardless of inflation, every productive organization, to cover the cost of creating their product (B), must inevitably charge prices higher than the purchasing power they grant to their workers in the form of wages (A). Through our Social Credit system, we shall enhance this purchasing power, so that both workers and the factory they labor in can both receive their just rewards for their essential work."
QUE_Pat_Our_Own_Way:0 "Our Own Way"
QUE_Pat_Our_Own_Way_desc:0 "Quebec is not Canadian, despite the desires of some. Quebec also is not French, despite the desires of many. And above all else, Quebec is certainly not American. We shall make clear these facts through actively separating Quebec from any similarities to these three nations, in culture, economics, and government: We shall go our own way, and in doing so, maintain our unique identity."
QUE_Pat_Electors:0 "The Union of Creditiiste Electors"
QUE_Pat_Electors_desc:0 "An aspect of democracy that is often forgotten is the fact that each elected representative is supposed to represent the people's interest in the region in which they were elected, not the party for which they were elected. While political parties have made this nearly irrelevant, the people still have a right to enforce their will upon those they give power to, in the form of petitions and even simply voicing their opinions directly to their elected official. We will encourage this behaviour as much as possible through the creation of the Union of Creditiiste Electors, and thus meet direct democracy and representative democracy at the halfway point."
QUE_Pat_Isolation:0 "Quebecois Isolationism"
QUE_Pat_Isolation_desc:0 "Our nation is young and vulnerable: The Anglo-Canadians eye our lands hungrily, desperate to reclaim us once again from even the slightest of provocations. We cannot risk our newly won independence with any sort of treaty or alliance with a foreign power: Beyond mere neutrality, Quebec shall adopt a policy of isolationism, as needed to safeguard our freedom."
QUE_Pat_Germans:0 "Open Up To The Germans"
QUE_Pat_Germans_desc:0 "The Third Reich is the sworn enemy of the British, and thus their Canadian lap dogs as well. While we certainly have no intentions of a full alliance, if any nation on this Earth would be willing to help us establish ourselves, and what's more, build up a force strong enough to resist the Canadians should they ever come, it would be the new Germany. We shall establish friendly ties immediately."
QUE_Pat_Antizionist:0 "Destroy Zionist Influence"
QUE_Pat_Antizionist_desc:0 "Whether our affinity for the Germans is official government policy or not, none can deny that their efforts to curtail the global Zionist conspiracy are most admirable in nature. While we are in no place to go as far as they have, there are still steps we can take to reduce the power of the Judeo-Bolsheviks in our great Christian nation."
QUE_Pat_Fuck_Unions:0 "Eradicate Leftist Unions"
QUE_Pat_Fuck_Unions_desc:0 "Everyone knows that trade unions are breeding grounds for reds: Socialists, communists, and even anarcho-syndicalists, plotting to one day seize control! While this is obviously nothing more than a childish fantasy, we can still ensure that it remains a mere childish fantasy: Any union that wishes to persist will have to swear loyalty not just to the nation, but to our government as well, in addition to openly denouncing leftism. The rest will be dismantled accordingly."
QUE_Pat_Economics:0 "Social Credit Economics"
QUE_Pat_Economics_desc:0 "By far the most important part of our agenda, so much so that we have named ourselves after it, is implementing a Social Credit system for Quebec. No longer will the man forgotten by capitalism perish in starvation while others sit on their wealth, prospering yet doing nothing with their gains: The wealth shall be redistributed, and through which, we shall enrich our people both literally and figuratively!"
QUE_Pat_Nationalization:0 "Resource Nationalization"
QUE_Pat_Nationalization_desc:0 "Despite the lack of fossil fuels, Quebec is a nation blessed with natural resources. Lumber, mining, fishing, hydroelectricity: All flourishing industries. Why should these profitable markets be exploited by corporations loyal only to their profits, refusing to contribute to our economy with even the most basic of taxes, when they can be exploited by us instead? Nationalization shall now become an official government policy, and we shall reap the rewards from it."
QUE_Pat_Never_Again:0 "Never Another Montreal"
QUE_Pat_Never_Again_desc:0 "The ‘Canadians,' truly mere Anglos in disguise, let the whole world know what they truly thought of us in Montreal. We were not their equal partners, as they so claimed, but mere vermin, to be beaten down, or exterminated if we do not comply. But in their fervor to eliminate us, they overplayed their hand, and were forced to grant us the freedom we have fought for for centuries. That freedom will never be taken! There will never again be the mere ‘province' of Quebec! Never again ‘Francophone Canada!' And NEVER another Montreal!"
QUE_Pat_Vaterland:0 "The Christian Nationalist Fatherland!"
QUE_Pat_Vaterland_desc:0 "We have turned Quebec into the nation it has always meant to be: Modernized. Democratic. Free. Moral. Equal. Independent. Patriotic. And of course, Catholic. The dream of so many before us has come true: The Acadians. The Patriotes. Louis Riel. For them, we have triumphed. For them, we have established the christian nationalist fatherland. Vive le Québec Libre!"

QUE_Lib_Victory:0 "MSA Victory!"
QUE_Lib_Victory_desc:0 "The MSA has won the election! The Liberal party of Quebec, the MSA will guarantee that everyone gets a fair opportunity to succeed in life, and guarantee a liberal Quebec for years to come."
QUE_Lib_Tolerance:0 "A Tolerant Republic"
QUE_Lib_Tolerance_desc:0 "We must guarantee every one of our citizens their inalienable rights, not just those who happen to be the majority. We will issue new protections for minorities and English speakers still in Quebec, as well as discourage religious nationalism. Quebec is for Quebecois, but anyone can become Quebecois should they choose to."
QUE_Lib_Federalism:0 "Cooperative Federalism"
QUE_Lib_Federalism_desc:0 "Others would give too much autonomy to the state governments, making the Federal government ineffective and weak. Others would also give too much power to the Federal government, making the voices of the people unheard. The MSA will strike a balance of power between the two, making sure that the Federal government will respect the will of the states, and the states will respect the authority of the Federal government."
QUE_Lib_Common_Currency:0 "Fixed Exchange Rate"
QUE_Lib_Common_Currency_desc:0 "The young Quebec Franc is a somewhat unstable currency. By fixing the exchange rate between the Franc and the American Dollar, we can encourage foreign investments and improve our economic stability."
QUE_Lib_Pan_American_Union:0 "Encourage North American Investments"
QUE_Lib_Pan_American_Union_desc:0 "As a part of the North American community, the best way to stabilize our young market is to encourage fellow North American regimes to invest in our national economy. With subsidies and other incentives, the ease of doing businesses would be drastically improved by our measures."

QUE_LibSD_Secular:0 "The Secularization Project"
QUE_LibSD_Secular_desc:0 "Quebec is not a specifically Catholic nation, and religion has no place in the government. Taking inspiration from our American brothers to the south, we will formally separate church and state to further guarantee religious freedoms. This is sure to ease tensions with the Anglo population still within our borders, stabilizing the nation as a whole."
QUE_LibSD_Immigration:0 "Relax Immigration"
QUE_LibSD_Immigration_desc:0 "People are a nation’s best assets. By relaxing immigration, we can allow more cheap labour and talents to flow into the Quebec market, strengthening the economy and our nation’s diversity."
QUE_LibSD_Culture:0 "Promote Quebecois Culture"
QUE_LibSD_Culture_desc:0 "Much of Quebecois culture was suppressed by the Canadians, and what little autonomies we had were not enough. We will fund entertainment that subtly educates people on the culture of Quebec, as well as directly teaching about it in schools. The French language will become the primary language of Quebec, and we will encourage its usage as much as possible. In time, we will erase the stains left on Quebec by the Canadians, and it all starts with this."
QUE_LibSD_Welfare:0 "Social Welfare Reforms"
QUE_LibSD_Welfare_desc:0 "Leaving the Quebecois worker to die and fend for himself is a sure way to get our government voted out. It will also make our government look better, as who wants to vote for someone else when the party in charge has given you assistance? We will provide the poor of Quebec with programs dedicated to helping them find financial stability and peace. Pensions will be rolled out, and all in Quebec will prosper."
QUE_LibSD_Minorities:0 "Rights for Minorities"
QUE_LibSD_Minorities_desc:0 "Our country is a free one, and we cannot let a single person be discriminated against. There is still a substantial Anglo minority within our nation, and they would rather our newfound country be annexed back into Canada. We must guarantee their rights and protect them to keep them happy. This will significantly make the country more stable, as well as making the Anglo populace more cooperative."

QUE_SD_Victory:0 "RIN Victory!"
QUE_SD_Victory_desc:0 "The Social Democratic party of Quebec, the RIN, has triumphed in the election! NO longer will the people of Quebec have their lives dictated by the capitalist, the people shall be free! The RIN promises strong welfare reform as well as more worker rights, policies that have obviously appealed to the large base of working class voters."
QUE_SD_Unions:0 "Empower the Unions"
QUE_SD_Unions_desc:0 "To truly free the worker, we must make them able to take freedom for themselves. To do this they must be organized, and what better way to organize than a union? We will grant more protections to the trade unions of Quebec so that the average Quebecois worker may grant themselves their own freedoms rather than have their pay dictated solely by the capitalist."
QUE_SD_Nationalization:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
QUE_SD_Nationalization_desc:0 "The industry of Quebec is for all, not just the bosses. We must nationalize key industrial conglomerates to better aid the poor workers of Quebec. We can more directly enforce our standards if we control some corporations directly or almost directly."
QUE_SD_Fuck_Tankies:0 "Weed Out Extremists"
QUE_SD_Fuck_Tankies_desc:0 "The RIN has some less than acceptable elements in society. Anarchists and Communists seek more radical changes that most consider to be too extreme. These people also are willing to commit terror attacks to accomplish their nefarious goals. We must weed out these terrorists so we don't look like a bunch of crazed extremists to the public."
QUE_SD_AVG:0 "The Revolutionary Avant-Garde"
QUE_SD_AVG_desc:0 "A beautiful thing has happened. We have evidently done a good job of running the country, as more and more university students have begun to take an interest in politics. Most support us, and see us as the saviors of Quebec. New art and writing in support of us has been released, and this new voter base has guaranteed our position in the government. It seems as if an entire culture has formed around us, and we have benefitted massively from us."

QUE_Con_Victory:0 "Ralliement Nationale Victory!"
QUE_Con_Victory_desc:0 "Ralliement National have successfully won the election and will now be able to bring Quebec into an economic & cultural golden age! Our reforms will begin soon and we will swiftly bring Quebec onto the world stage"
QUE_The_Bilingualism_Issue:0 "The Bilingualism Issue"
QUE_The_Bilingualism_Issue_desc:0 "We won the vote on the preface that we’d address the cultural issue in the room, the question of the anglo-quebecues, who’ve for centuries sat in limbo between the influence of Quebec City and Toronto. To this end we must solve the first of many hurdles, the Bilingualism Issue. It doesn’t make sense that someone living in an english-speaking country should have to learn french alongside english, and vice versa. It shall be french or english, not both."
QUE_Con_Values:0 "Maintain Christian Values"
QUE_Con_Values_desc:0 "It is a time-tested statement that a moral country is a quiet country. That is to say, if we stick to our christian, moral values, we shall continue on in peace and prosperity, and not collapse into barbarism like that of the German Sphere. But it won’t be enough to just maintain christian values, we must reinforce them. Church to pure the mind, sacred devotion to put the strength of muscle to the labor of state."
QUE_Con_Education:0 "Education Subsidies"
QUE_Con_Education_desc:0 "We must admit, today our educational system is a joke. Young Quebecois boys drop out of education to help their parents pay, and those that do graduate see little more opportunity.  It is even worse for girls, most never end up going due to the high tuition their parents must pay. If we are to achieve the strength that we desire, we must reform this system with a wave of sweeping subsidies. Only then, with smart men and women helming the vast natural resources our land possesses, will we achieve the economic fortitude we so require."
QUE_Con_Econ:0 "Modified Social Credit Economics"
QUE_Con_Econ_desc:0 "Part of our agenda is setting up some of the ideas from the social credit movement. No longer will the man forgotten by capitalism perish in starvation while others sit on their wealth, prospering yet doing nothing with their gains: The wealth shall be redistributed, and through which, we shall enrich our people both literally and figuratively!"
QUE_Con_Family:0 "Supporting the Christian Family"
QUE_Con_Family_desc:0 "In line with our reinforcement of Christian values, we must support Christian families. The Americans, for instance, have the nuclear family, and look where they have gone. We shall do the same. The Quebecios family will be the bedrock which we build our nation on. Social programs encouraging family building will be the manner in which we build this bedrock, mixing German and American ideas into something uniquely Quebecois."
QUE_Con_Development:0 "Public Works Initiative"
QUE_Con_Development_desc:0 "The Ameircans in the 30s, with almost a quarter of working men out of a job, managed to bring themselves back into the limelight with programs that employed millions in public works. Bridges, roads, hospitals, infrastructure. It was all laid with the hands of the common man, which not only gave them spending money, but also improved the overall situation. We shall do the same. Roads will cross the harsh forests and lakes of the north to the lush plains of the south. This will not only lay the literal and metaphorical groundwork for further development, but also line the pockets of workers and reinvigorate the economy."
QUE_Con_Unemployment:0 "Unemployment Benefits"
QUE_Con_Unemployment_desc:0 "If a man loses his job today, it is uncertain he will survive the next winter. At the same time the rich become fat pigs off their immense wealth. This cannot stand. The corrective measure we shall take is to set up safety nets to protect the unemployed from being pulled by the undertow of the economic wave. To this extent programs like a social security system, universal welfare, and guaranteed maternity leave should be enacted."
QUE_Con_Unions:0 "Controlling the Unions"
QUE_Con_Unions_desc:0 "We’ve seen what happens when Unions grow too strong. They simply become the overbearing dictators they claim to destroy. It is not only in the good will of businesses, but workers as well, that we control this serpent. Workers will remain with the leverage a Union allows, but under no circumstance will we let them grow stronger than they already are. Perhaps we could even use them..."
QUE_Con_Housing:0 "National Housing Act"
QUE_Con_Housing_desc:0 "Over the past few decades housing prices have only risen. Land as well, has become bloated in price. It is only a matter of time this bubble pops, and we cannot let that come to fruition. Instead we will deflate it and bring the housing market back into line with reforms and buy-outs. The Quebecois Dream will be housed in cheap, modern housing."
QUE_Con_Relief:0 "Agricultural Relief Legislation"
QUE_Con_Relief_desc:0 "The current status of the Agricultural Sector is a mess of convoluted local regulations, corporate nepotism, and reeks of corruption. A decisive and total overhaul of the regulation to not only improve output, but also set up hard rules, limit interference by foreign companies, and relieve the beleaguered farmers. To start, a system of investigations into all farms across the country should be undertaken. Overfarming, soil deterioration, and deforestation will only set time-bombs for our agricultural output in the long run, so stopping these first will be the imperative. After this, we can start thinking about possible regulation on who can farm where, and get into the minutia of land laws."
QUE_Con_Catholic:0 "A New, Catholic Republic"
QUE_Con_Catholic_desc:0 "After years of hard work and sheer will, we have reformed Quebec. We may not be the powerhouse of America, or China, but we have improved our situation. Christian ideals of morality have become the staple of the Republic. Every Quebecios has a home and a job, and the vibrant Agricultural Sector has seen improvements in crop yields by almost 10 fold already. "

QUE_The_August_Revolution:0 "The August Revolution"
QUE_The_August_Revolution_desc:0 "The Quebecois people have finally overthrown the Anglo-Imperialist chains that have bound them for so long! The Quebecois workers will now decide their own future, free and regardless of Anglo-Imperialist wishes!"
QUE_Seize_The_Means_Of_Production:0 "Seize The Means Of Production"
QUE_Seize_The_Means_Of_Production_desc:0 "Without the Anglo bosses, Quebecois workers will be able to work in their factories without a tyrannical fat cat watching from above. Workers will hold the means of productions today, tomorrow, and forevermore!"
QUE_Meeting_Of_The_Five_Federations:0 "Meeting Of The Five Federations"
QUE_Meeting_Of_The_Five_Federations_desc:0 "All corners of the Quebecois working class will meet to discuss further plans for our nation and all will meet to decide the future of a state by workers, for workers."
QUE_Secularization_Process:0 "Secularization Process"
QUE_Secularization_Process_desc:0 "Quebec will not be a religious state like the reactionaries of old! Quebec will be a place free from the chains of traditional faith, and move forth towards a secular future."
QUE_Cooperating_With_The_FSQ:0 "Cooperating With The FSQ"
QUE_Cooperating_With_The_FSQ_desc:0 "Though a violent and dangerous group, the FSQ and Fred Rose have proved their worth to the revolutionary cause, so we shall try and work with them."
QUE_Abolish_The_Old_Assembly:0 "Abolish The Old Assembly"
QUE_Abolish_The_Old_Assembly_desc:0 "The old systems of a tyrannical anglo-capitalist past shall be swept away by the sands of history."
QUE_True_Equality:0 "True Equality"
QUE_True_Equality_desc:0 "Queer or Straight, White or Black, Old or Young, all will share the same opportunities; equal opportunities."
QUE_Sweeping_Social_Welfare_Reforms:0 "Sweeping Social Welfare Reforms"
QUE_Sweeping_Social_Welfare_Reforms_desc:0 "To guarantee equal opportunities, we must first ensure that all people share a safe upbringing and a safe economic life."
QUE_Remembering_Montreal:0 "Remembering Montreal"
QUE_Remembering_Montreal_desc:0 "We must dedicate something to the faithful workers who were wrongfully slaughtered by the previous government. We must know our history, even if some want to repeat what they learned."
QUE_Abolish_Private_Ownership:0 "Abolish Private Ownership"
QUE_Abolish_Private_Ownership_desc:0 "Private property is the bedrock idea of capitalism. If we cut the source, the cancer will die."
QUE_The_Anti_Fascist_Vanguard:0 "The Anti-Fascist Vanguard"
QUE_The_Anti_Fascist_Vanguard_desc:0 "The Quebecois people have successfully broken their chains from the former capitalist fat cats and now stand as the vanguard against the fascist reactionaries and their capitalist cousins."
QUE_Quebecois_Syndicalism:0 "Québécois Syndicalism"
QUE_Quebecois_Syndicalism_desc:0 "Our new republic was founded on the principles of unions, we cannot allow the tyrannical FSQ to take that from us."
QUE_Rehabilitate_The_Bourgeoisie:0 "Rehabilitate The Bourgeoisie"
QUE_Rehabilitate_The_Bourgeoisie_desc:0 "Though enemies of the working class, the Bourgeoisie have their uses. If we are able to show these people the light of syndicalism, we may be able to bring them into the revolutionary fold."
QUE_Worker_Cooperatives:0 "Worker Cooperatives"
QUE_Worker_Cooperatives_desc:0 "Only by letting the workers control and self-manage there own work places will the workers truly be free."
QUE_A_Universal_Labour_Agreement:0 "A Universal Labour Agreement"
QUE_A_Universal_Labour_Agreement_desc:0 "All workers must be united and free under the union, however freedom of association must be paramount at all costs."
QUE_Autonomous_Unionism:0 "Autonomous Unionism"
QUE_Autonomous_Unionism_desc:0 "Though we are united as a union, workers and their own unions must be free of a repeat of the government before our own."
QUE_State_Decentralization:0 "State Decentralization"
QUE_State_Decentralization_desc:0 "By decentralizing the state and giving more power to local workplaces and governors, we can prevent tyranny from above."
QUE_Quebecois_Leninism:0 "Québécois Leninism"
QUE_Quebecois_Leninism_desc:0 "The Syndicalists are weak and everyone knows it. The people require order and action, and deliver we shall. Leninism will safeguard the people from enemies of all sides, and ultimately bring the working class of Quebec into a new era."
QUE_Purge_Reactionary_Culture:0 "Purge Reactionary Culture"
QUE_Purge_Reactionary_Culture_desc:0 "In order to defend our new order, we must solidify our cultural presence. Any and all media from the former quebecois government and the Toronto Accord is to be confiscated and burned or purged in anyway. We shall be the masters of our future."
QUE_Collectivize_The_Countryside:0 "Collectivize The Countryside"
QUE_Collectivize_The_Countryside_desc:0 "In order to create a fair and truly communist society, we must achieve this through collectivizing the countryside to ensure that every man, woman and child gets their fair share."
QUE_Cement_The_Party:0 "Cement The Party"
QUE_Cement_The_Party_desc:0 "Nothing will escape the grasp of the party. All media will be the party. All events will be the party. All for the party, and nothing but the party."

While we of course rejected any attempt to conscript our brave fighting age men into an Anglo-Canadian war that was not our own, there will be no shortage of volunteers to join a fighting force specifically for defending our hard fought independence. Canada itself could not field a particularly large military, even with our numbers bolstering their ranks. Alone, we are all the more miniscule.

And the choice that Quebecers will have is extremely interesting to the observer's eye. The first party to come on the scene with very mixed ideas, The Credisties, a party made up of classic conservatism that dominated the political scenes of the 1920s. Credisties offer with them strictly Catholicism, with highly debatable ideas of the social credit economy, to incidents that included both anti-Semitism and anti-communism. The next party that has the right to be elected, the more lenient conservative party RN, which aims at certain similarities with the Credisties, while the more lenient natures when it comes to left-wing issues and the trade and workers' unions themselves, whom they keep them under control. all this spiced up their Catholicism. The RIN party offers with it indications of socialist politics, imbued with the democratization of Quebec, but with an economy similar to that of the Socialists, where key industries will go under the control of the state and where nationalization will take place. The MSA party is perhaps the most liberal, compared to other parties, of a force that can bring Quebecers tolerance towards other nations and races under their jurisdiction, as well as an example of corporate federalism aimed at a symbiosis of federal and state government, in which jointly adopt reforms in line with the desired objectives. Whoever wins this election will leave deep consequential roots that will shape the future of independent Quebec."

He begins the speech praising Quebec's choice in leaving, saying "Quebec is an Anglo colony no longer, and by god's will we have chosen our own destiny!" halfway through his speech, an unknown assailant storms the stage and shoots at the president.

twrquebec.3.d:0 "Although Quebec has been under British rule for many decades, the history of Quebec is linked to French culture and the French-speaking area, it has always been culturally separated from the rest of Canada. Now that we are no longer under the influence of the English, it has been decided to start a debate on what the official language of the government should be, and accordingly what the official language of Quebec should be. After a heated discussion that lasted for some time, it was finally decided what their position should be on that issue. Significant arguments were made in favor of the English language having a place in the government, while the traditionalists presented arguments that the French language is of historical and cultural significance for Quebec. Now is the time to appear before the people, so that it can be said what decision was made."

After the RN party led by Gilles Gregoire decided that it was necessary to pass a decree banning the work of certain parties, the decree was met with massive rejection and dissatisfaction, by the Communists and Socialists, as well as by the Provisional Government of accused autocrats, who aim to destroy the unity and democracy of government. The decree also had to go through Parliament, so that it could be approved, and sent to the President to sign it, for which the day may finally have come. His advisor appeared at the door, while he was sitting on a chair and working on something. "Good afternoon, president, the Provisional Government has referred me to you, to convey the news of the meeting." "Tell me, what happened there?" "The debate was fierce, and many were against these actions, while the other side argued that a strong hand was needed." "Okay, is it decided to implement the decree to the level of signing?"

This morning, a bomb was blown up outside Montreal's police headquarters killing five. A new group that calls themselves the "Front du Salut du Quebec" has claimed responsibility, claiming it is fighting to preserve union rights and "Bring the socialist revolution to Quebec".

Seeing the extreme wealth disparity between the rural and urban districts of Quebec, the Trade Unionists have argued for a more federalized state that lets the districts handle their own affairs. The Communists on the other hand have countered this by arguing for a more unitary state wherein the central government can more easily administer everything. Following long bouts of deliberation..."

There is however no denying that the church has remained complacent as capitalistic robber-barons plundered our great nation. The communist ministers wasted little time in stressing this point, also referring to Marxist-Leninist principles of rejecting "organs of bourgeois reaction" and taking a hardline atheistic stance. The syndicalistic trade unions however have stressed leniency, believing that such a drastic move would alienate the common folk and have instead suggested a secularist government.

While many have already embraced the concept of a Quebecois identity, there are also many that still see themselves as Canadians who plot behind closed doors to bring us back under Anglo occupation. The Communists of course see little choice but to do away with these old sentiments by force if necessary, however the moderate syndicalists have once again stressed leniency so that the transition into an independent socialist state is smoother than it was for states like Soviet Russia.

As the other cars got their bearings, fifteen men armed with machine guns came out of nearby buildings and cars and opened fire on the motorcade puncturing their tires. In a last ditch attempt at protecting Chartand and the other CSN union leaders, their bodyguards got out of the cars and exchanged fire with the assassins. Attempting to make their way off the street, Chartand and his two bodyguards were gunned down on the sidewalk and as sirens wailed in the distance as police and ambulances began to arrive, the communist terrorists responsible slipped out of sight altogether leaving what looks like a war scene and the blood of politicians."

At exactly 5:00AM there was a massive police raid just on the FSQ headquarters just outside Montreal. Surrounding the communist safehouse, a brief firefight broke out all while FSQ militiamen threw Molotov Cocktails at the police outside. Eventually the police broke their way into the house, they found Fred Rose willingly surrender. In the basement, there were makeshift pipe bombs, guns, ammunition, fake passports and more. Now in police custody, it is likely that Mr. Rose be found guilty on charges of terrorism and posessing explosives."

Armed militias paid for by CPC donors have seized control of the national radio station, municipal police stations and forced ragtag army garrisons to surrender. At exactly 7:35 PM, Fred Rose announced over the television and the radio that Hitlerite forces have viciously gunned down the government's motorcade in an attempted nazi coup. He attempted to reassure the Quebecois people that the vanguard of the people's revolution will now be preserved by the Communist Party and the fascist fifth-columnists and their capitalist conspirators would be brought to justice."

In an overwhelming show of support, the syndicalist activist Michel Chartrand was elected. Announcing the new changes over the radio, Mr. Chartrand has declared the "August Revolution" to be an outstanding success, and that the people of Quebec are now free of the extremist bandits and the Quebecois people are now free in their pursuit of equality and the building of a socialist society."

The answer to those reforms came in the form of protests, which were now provided by the police, ready at any moment to do their job, which was to beat the people.

"Let all the lackeys of this government, and all the lackeys who secure this lynching of peace, and the lynching of the administration of justice, take to the streets, to look their people in the eye!" Oysters were now becoming more common, hitting more and more police officers, and one broke through the window of Real's office. Reaching for the phone, he said, "Break up the riots. And use live ammunition." Panic reigned in the streets, when police ran to meet the protest, with batons in their hands and pistols singing a song of rebellion. A song of rebellion. The people then rushed at them, while the other side turned back, but the police caught up with them. Blood could be seen everywhere, as well as teeth erupted during a fight with police, and the breaking of a riot that lasted only an hour. Soon everything was stabilized.

But there were several problems with this plan that made the plan even more difficult. (Contrary to several virtues of this idea) Namely, the design did not suit anyone in public opinion, as a substitute for the currency they used so far, while proponents of this idea thought that a "certificate of prosperity" would be a good example of Quebec separating from its home country, and builds its identity. As in the original idea from 1936, the design also made a problem, because the certificate had one small stamp almost invisible that easily fell, and the so-called prosperity was immediately lost, but there was no one to buy this currency. This problem was solved after the government issued a new version of the certificate with a stamp that would be larger in size, and would be easier to fit. President Real managed to push this in front of the Parliament, and the law was approved by the voters."

After earlier tests, and their later manufacture, televisions slowly reached the homes of the bourgeoisie, but also ordinary middle-class citizens. After some time, realizing the great threat posed by televisions, an evangelical group of St. Michael's pilgrims threw everything they could find into the streets, lynching local shops selling televisions, and then set them on fire. Considering that "televisions are one of Satan's inventions that will lead to the decadence of the Christian faith, created under the influence of the Jews in order to destroy further generations, if not their contemporaries," they began to destroy, as already mentioned, all televisions that came under their control by hand. The affair culminated when the top pilgrims sought an audience with the president of Real, while on the other hand, the pilgrims began smashing TVs with hammers, claiming that "they do not want to inhale the fumes of satanic devices by lighting them, but it is easier to break the TV by hand." A meeting soon followed.\n\nOnce inside, President Real offered them water and coffee, because he knew that if TVs were a problem, then alcohol would be a bad idea. "What kind of protests are going on outside? Can anyone explain to me what all this is supposed to mean?" The first president of Real started, giving the pilgrims space to think, then to give an answer. "Our order opposes the popularization of television, Mr. President. We believe that it is a danger to the authority and tradition of our people who have suffered greatly, and it would not be a good idea to allow ordinary, cheap decadence to destroy our nation." Said one of the pilgrims, quite calmly, calmly, as if he had never even thought of burning the television. "What has that got to do with decadence?" That's what President Real said when the pilgrims got serious. "This is a blow to the very core of Christianity. Not only was the Bible ridiculed with the same genre when jazz came into being, if you remember that evil, but television will only further help anti-Christian and pro-Jewish propaganda spread, breaking the pillars of our faith. And don't forget that our group holds a good percentage of your votes." With the final sentence, as well as a couple of cheap excuses based on Christianity, this conversation ended, and President Real was forced to sign the law, just because the priests lobbied against the television."

"Slowly, slowly ..." He pointed to the soldier who had greeted the delivery of the television, to the driver so he could park easily. After he stopped, he got out of the truck, looking at its contents, and weighing it. "Who would throw such a beautiful and fine thing just like that?" "It's rumored that those crazy pilgrims thought it was a satanic device that could kill us." "For God's sake, what kind of people ..." the driver said, when a forklift arrived that picked up several pallets with fresh TVs on them.\n\nAfter a few hours, the first military exercise could take place, and the televisions were lined up in the field, while the soldiers were fifty meters away from them. "Look at it like this, these ... TVs ... don't laugh. They were sent here, so that we could use them in some way. That way was determined in Parliament for the purpose of military exercise." The commander began, while the soldiers stood still and listened to what he was saying, while some laughed at the very thought of shooting at the televisions. Continuing to explain to them, he said that there are more TVs in abundance, as well as days that will be used for exercises. The bullets hit directly in the center of the TV, turning it into an explosion of glass, plastic and cables. Who would have thought this would actually be fun? Continuing to fire, the TVs turned into unidentified objects at the end of the day, while the bullet casings remained in the crowd.

The president asked, while the ministers were studying the basic draft, ie the concept of the idea of summer Christian camps, because when you give children a school and a vacation from it, it is wise for them to go to another school when they are on vacation from school. As they continued to read, they realized that priests would be involved in this story, so they were a little skeptical of the idea. "Do you think it's a good idea to leave the priests alone with the children?" The Minister of Education asked, aware of the fact what the question actually meant.

In cooperation with our police and agency, we will provide evidence of how they benefited from tax evasion. there will be good enough justifications to remove all the directors, and shut them down, while appointing the directors of our smithy, who will do everything as we see fit."\n\n"Ingenious.""

After breaking the churches with his foot, and raiding, the priests were arrested and taken to the stations, while the Bishop of Montreal was advised not to reconsider the motives of these arrests, but to agree with them, and to allow the priests to take away land, as well as churches, and to they join the state estates. After this action, by force of sincerity, was approved by Bishop Paul Emil Leger, they all surrendered later in the afternoon, and with this action every kind of clergy was demolished, and they were given "modest" estates on the outskirts, to leave the appearance of ecclesial unity under forced secularization. The bishop continued to perform his duty, but in very modest conditions."

twrquebecflavor.26.d:0 "The car could finally see the lights of the Vermont American state, whose borders were supported by all the bourgeois people who "decided" to leave the country, for the benefit of the honest and working people of the workers' and trade unions. The border guards knew very well the reasons why a bunch of powdered gays with a gold ring on their hand and a decent suit were moving towards the border, but since the bourgeoisie is not as stupid as it seems at first glance, they realized that they should change into someone poorer. Now, a new problem arises, because ... well, look at it this way. When you never see a poor person, or anything, there can be some inconveniences like getting dressed in a walking circus and pretending to know a poor language. I know, I know, it's funny because it's true.\n\n"Passports, please." The Quebec customs officer said in a tired voice, because he knew what was happening. "Here you go, good and honest sir." I told you about this a few moments ago. Capitalism can be expelled from the state, but it cannot be expelled from the heart of an iron man. "Thanks." The passport was a little messy, but there was no doubt that it was real, even though it was fake, but it was all because of the acting. Then the customs officer gave one serious look, looking the man straight in the eye, and it took ten awkward seconds, to say, "Thank you, you can pass." The car continued in the direction of Vermont, while the customs officer still suspected that it was a capitalist, but the peasants also know how to have a decent language and a messy passport. And so at all border crossings, somewhere successfully, somewhere unsuccessfully. The arrests were made, someone's fate was unknown, some ended up in prison, of course on account of their former financial situation, while some were lucky enough to escape and find refuge in Canada and America, in this case in Vermong. Although, why on earth would anyone want to go to Vermont?"

"Do you take, in your right mind and sanity, without compulsion to this holy sacrament, Victor, for your lawful husband, in good and in evil, and in sickness and in health, and in want and prosperity, until death do you part?" "I'll take." Another short and clear answer came from his chest. "You can kiss." A short but strong kiss united Michelle and Victor into a marital union, while people began to applaud, ie those who had supported them so far. We don't want to talk about the others, because I don't want to mention all the words that come to my mind. The ceremony was performed in the church, while the organization for the first marriage of homosexual decriminalization was funded by the state, and it was held in the church for a reason in order to drive a nail into the eye of Roman Catholics, in the eye of minors. Marriages, abandonment of homosexuality, and similar abominations were finally put under lock and key, and people were finally able to enjoy the freedom God had entrusted to them, even though a Stoic Christian would argue that this was not true by reading a poorly translated Bible. After this law was pushed through, people finally breathed the air, although still polluted by conservatism, of freedom. When a man can love freely, he does not need more freedom than that, even if he is in prison."

While Christians argued "that abortion is a procedure that has killed more people than fascists in Europe" is the other side, supporting "the freedom and self-determination of women, without the right of men to interfere in their decisions", and vice versa when women could not interfere in the decisions of men. The conservative brain is amazing. After the procession full of pilgrims and churchmen stopped the doctor who was in charge of performing the operation, the police were called to intervene regarding this incident, because the doctor was literally stoned by an angry mob. Retreating behind their car, when the police arrived, the crowd shouted "you can't dispute and destroy God's work" while on the other hand they shouted "Death to the murderers", which was extremely ironic. After the police intervened and arrested all the lynchers, the doctor entered the hospital in order to arrive at the scheduled operation, ie the abortion of the woman who was among the first to appear."

His works for medicine were extremely important, because he revolutionized blood transfusions, which helped many dying soldiers by bringing them back to life. By borrowing from both the Spaniards and the Chinese during the war, he gained the affection and respect of Mao Zedong, who dedicated even one eulogy to him. Doing everyone a favor around him, he acquired the title of socialist martyr for a reason, the right given to him by President Rose, after the successful takeover of power, after the fall of trade unionism."

By swearing allegiance to his Christian people, secretly to Fred Rose, the bishop immediately subordinated all ecclesiastical matters to the state, directly linking the two bodies into one, although the church has now become Fred Rose's extended arm so that he can control the Christian people without difficulty. so that his words will come out on the lips of the new bishop, while Paul Emile Leger is taken to an unknown place."

Still in his episcopal suit, he tried to get up, even with a chair, but his legs were also tied. The footsteps could be heard coming from a distance, light as death, strong as a steel fist. Then he saw a dark figure appear in front of him, to close the door. "Please release me." The bishop said softly and weakly as the man moved to stand behind him. "Please. Please. Release me." He kept talking, to feel the hands on his neck, and the jerk of a millisecond, before the hands moved away from his neck, He remained motionless, and the man just left the room, leaving the bishop to the people in charge of throwing the corpses."

Then bursts of gunfire came in his direction, but he successfully hid behind the wall, when he fired another target, hitting and throwing the soldier backwards. Severely wounded, he died of bleeding after 10 minutes. Going in pursuit of him, a short shot was fired before he turned to continue firing at them, and he fell to the ground, mixing his blood with earth dust. "This one wasn't hard. You should have seen the massacre where we came from." There was an excuse for the soldiers to tell stories of stubborn peasants still refusing to hand over their land so that the government could dispose of them. Somewhere the peasants surrendered, somewhere scenes like this happened, but collectivization was delayed due to such incidents compared to Rose's intentions."

They had to take cover, so that they could wash their consciences elsewhere. After they managed to slip through the forest that divided the two roads on which the patrols were located, they passed quietly, to step on a branch. "Go see what's going on." The soldier moved in that direction, so that they would continue at an accelerated pace to move towards their salvation. Then the soldier noticed them, so he fired, and the bullet hit a man who was killed on the spot. Then they started running as fast as they could, so they barely managed to pull out a live head, while the soldiers gave up the chase after the second kilometer. Freedom was paid, and they won, but at what price? Resting next to a tree, they glanced at the place and state they had previously called their state, to finally end their journey in a local village in Canada. They succeeded, they saved themselves."
