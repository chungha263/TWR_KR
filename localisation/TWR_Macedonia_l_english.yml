MCD_The_Reorganised_North_Macedonian_State_desc:0 "Our proud people have been given the chance to bring our nation back into the light of life, to finally free themselves of the shackles of forgein Empires and to stand with our Greek brethren against the false tyranny of the many nations who enslaved us for centuries. Greek boots now patrol our native soil as it always was intended, and it will be the duty of every last Macedonian to join them in their ranks to ensure the integrity and security of a Greater and free Hellenic Empire. We shall do the legacy of Alexander the Great proud, as his children have embraced the light of Nationalism! The Macedonian people march on!"

MCD_Operation_Red_Pox_desc:0 "The failed south slavic Kingdom of Yugoslavia may have been destroyed well over a decade ago, but their pesky spirit of their inferior people still lives on to this very day. They still dream of a Macedonia under the heel of the Serbian brutes, a dream that shall always just stay that very thing, nothing but a fantasy of the deranged. The government in consultation with the Hellenic Reich have authorised the plans for a military operation dubbed "Red Pox" which shall put an immediate and eternal halt to these insane and dangerous ongoings. Any people of slavic descent who are suspected of having committed treason against the Macedonian and Greek Government are to be executed immediately with only their leaders to be spared and captured by our special forces so that we can put them on trial in Skopje for their crimes against the state!"
MCD_Aryan_Sons_of_Alexander:0 "Aryan Sons of Alexander"
MCD_Aryan_Sons_of_Alexander_desc:0 "The greatest Macedonian to ever roam the mortal realm of the world was undoubtedly Alexander the Great, a man of courage, intallect, fierce strength and perfectioned leadership, the ideal image of what an Aryan man should be. He and only he shall be the image all Macedonians shall judge themselves by, as he is to be seen as the lord and saviour of our people. Macedonia shall one day be a nation in his image, perfected, pure, proud and strong, like he would have wanted it to be. Lang Lebe Alexander der Große, Sohn des Arischen Volkes!"
MCD_Macedonia_Calls_its_Sons:0 "Macedonia Calls Her Sons"
MCD_Macedonia_Calls_its_Sons_desc:0 "Our Greek overlord is in desperate need of men with which to defend their native soil from any forgein intervention by Judeo-Bolsheviks and Capitalists alike! It has become evident that we must provide any means necessary to ensure the continued safety for the Balkan-Ordnungspakt as our holy duty is to protect it, even with our lives. We shall call to the sons of Macedonia, the sons of our great Fatherland and our proud legacy, to take upon themselves the duty as Soldiers in the name of a truly strong Macedonian State which would be worthy to carry this very name..."
MCD_In_the_Steps_of_Great_Alexander:0 "In the Steps of Great Alexander"
MCD_In_the_Steps_of_Great_Alexander_desc:0 "From the Greek shores of the Adriatic to the West, the Macedonian Mountains to our North, the river Nile in the South and to the Indus River in the East, the Empire of our forefather Alexander the Great stretched far and wide across the known world. A conqueror like no other before him and none since then in Greek history, he has truly left his mark as the one and only Emperor of the Greeks. We shall take the very steps that he took into greatness o' so long ago in the days of his long gone Realm. Our Soldiers shall be fierce as wolves, with an unbendable strong will like steel and a loyalty that encompasses their very being. The enemies of Hellas shall tremble when they hear the name Macedonia!"
MCD_Put_Bulgarians_to_Work:0 "Put Bulgarians to Work"
MCD_Put_Bulgarians_to_Work_desc:0 "During the years of the Second World War and beyond, the Germans put their "undesirables" to work, letting them work until they would drop dead in their work camps in Germany and former Eastern European territories in order to increase their productivity as well as to decrease the number of the subhumans. With many of our own undesirables still roaming free to poison the minds of the Macedonian people with the means of Judeo-Bolshevism the time seems ripe to put these inferior beings to work, most notably the people of Bulgarian descent of whom we have plenty within our borders. Any form of Slavic culture shall be crushed without any remorse, for this land belongs to the Hellens and the Hellens only!"
MCD_The_Macedonian_Phalanx:0 "The Macedonian Phalanx"
MCD_The_Macedonian_Phalanx_desc:0 "When our forefathers fought for our glory in ancient times, our enemies would immediately be utterly demoralised and tremble in their boots when they saw the Macedonian Phalanx enter upon the fields of battle. Some of our military advisors have therefore devised a somewhat revolutionary plan; a mixture of large soldier squads combined with our own Macedonian version of the Waffen-SS forces shall be used to strike utter fear into the hearts and minds of those who dare stand against these fierce warriors in battle. Death shall be their honor, murder shall be their warcry and honor shall be theirs for eternity!"
MCD_A_People_with_Grand_History:0 "A People with Grand History"
MCD_A_People_with_Grand_History_desc:0 "Atlas, the Macedonian spirit has been reborn to once more fill the hearts and minds of our people with utmost pride, loyalty and devotion to our long lost Fatherland which has risen out of the Grave! Every man shall do their duty to the state, every mother shall raise the new sons of the Macedon legacy and our children shall be taught by the old guard in the ways of our people to defend this land with every last drop of blood that may flow within their body! The Hellenic Reich and Macedonia stand united to march into the future as nations of the new order, the rulers of the new times where the world shall be ruled by only the perfect Aryans! May Alexander look upon us with pride and joy from the realm of Heaven, God protect thee, Land of Macedonia! "
