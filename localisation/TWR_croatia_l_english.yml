 ## Leader Descriptions ##
 #########################
 ANTE_PAVELIC_DESC:0 "Every nation has its national hero. For the Americans, it is Washington. For the Germans, Hitler. But many agree that there are few national heroes less deserving of such a title than Ante Pavelic, Poglavnik of Croatia. Along with national hero, he has found himself with many more, less flattering titles; among them terrorist, murderer, war criminal, and butcher. And, unlike "hero", each of these is true. Pavelic has led a regime of unmatched brutality, save for perhaps Germany's Eastern European territories. The Ustashe has engaged in a horrific campaign of cleansing and expelling Serbs, Jews, and Romani from Croatia, the brutality of which Heinrich Himmler allegedly had called "ridiculous".\n\nWith the tendrils of the Ustashe going from Zagreb to Dubrovnik, it seems that there will be no end to Croatia's woes. Every day, opponents of the regime, Jews, and Serbs are executed with methods often primitive and brutal. Pavelic's rule seems endless, with the partisans being hunted to the nation's borderlands and across the border. As Pavelic turns Croatia to feast upon her neighbours, the world wonders how long his shop of horrors can last."
 ANDRIJA_ARTUKOVIC_DESC:0 "For years, many considered Ante Pavelić's government to be a rogue state run by butchers. None of it would've been possible without his trusty deputy that now leads Croatia; Andrija Artuković. An early follower of the Ustaše and one of the late Poglavnik's closest ministers, Andrija had been instrumental in consolidating fascist rule in Croatia and with it the enforcement of the state's draconian racial and security laws. A fervent antisemite, he was tasked with pursuing a "Solution to the Jewish question", a job that he has undertaken with ruthless efficiency over the years. Now in charge of the Independent State of Croatia following the Poglavnik's unexpected death, Croatia's "Architect Of Terror" has brought the Jewel Of The Adriatic further into darkness as he works to fulfill Pavelić's legacy in the face of staunch opposition in Rome and Belgrade."
 MLADEN_LORKOVIC_DESC:0 "A short, unassuming man, Mladen Lorković was born in 1909 to prominent Croatian nationalist politicians. Joining the fledgling Ustaše movement early on, he quickly became a senior member within Pavelić's inner circle. Invited to join the Independent State of Croatia as a high ranking cabinet member, Mladen was made Minister of Foreign Affairs, securing diplomatic ties with allies of Nazi Germany's new European order. His time watching the European order stagnate and crumble following the death of Adolf Hitler made Lorković quickly become disillusioned with Ante Pavelić and the Ustaše as a whole, fearing that the same chain of events in Germany would happen to his nation; A fear that would come to fruition after Pavelić died. Seizing his opportunity in usurping Pavelić's successor Andrija Artuković in the midst of all the chaos, Mladen declared a coalition government with the formerly-ostracized Croatian Peasant's Party in the hopes of reshaping Croatia in the image of a modern fascist state as opposed to the old ideas of a clandestine terrorist organization in control of an entire nation-state."
 AUGUST_KOSUTIC_DESC:0 "August Košutić is someone that many consider to have been born to be a politician, a man who grew up surrounded by politicians and was invariably influenced by them. Born to HSS commissioners in 1893, young August had been baptized by HSS leader and Croatian nationalist Stjepan Radić and would prove to be an incredibly intelligent child. Spending much of his childhood reading the collective works of his ostracized godfather and mentor, he eventually married Radić’s daughter and became a highly influential Croatian politician within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.  Having been alienated by the Yugoslavian royal dictatorship, he reluctantly sided with the Ustaše when the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed, he had quickly found himself nothing more than a pawn for Ante Pavelić’s totalitarian grip on Croatia while going in and out of his prisons. Taking the leadership of the HSS after Maček’s death in Jasenovac,  Košutić would begin plotting behind closed doors with representatives of the Croatian Home Guard in the hopes of deposing the Ustaše altogether. Now finally the first democratic president of Croatia,  Košutić will work tirelessly to fulfill the legacies of his late mentors."
 TOMISLAV_II_DESC:0 "Considered a foreigner in his own kingdom, King Tomislav II was born Duke Aimone of Aosta-Savoy in 1900 and enrolled in the Italian naval academy, becoming well known for leading mountain climbing expeditions in Nepal. Having been initially promised and later denied the crown of Croatia following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, he had waited impatiently in Rome for his opportunity to arise, slowly learning the Croatian language and its people's customs so that he may one day be seen as their king. Now finally the King of Croatia in what many see as nothing more than an Italian colony, His Majesty still has a long way to go before his government will be considered legitimate by both foreign powers and the Croatian people."
 
 Crazy_Hamburger_Desc:0 "A mysterious figure in the beating heart of Bosnia, Joker Omčo is nonetheless a wanted criminal by the Ustase on crimes of civil disturbance and murder. A skilled chef, Omčo's village frequently describes him as a man known for having a hearty laugh and an insatiable appetite. His special dish, the "Crazy Hamburger" is a delicacy amongst the Bosnian people, including a variety of dishes from around the world. Cheese from Brazil, Bread from Turkey, oil from Iraq, horse meat, grass of death, red hot chili peppers and cooked on a thousand degrees, the "Crazy Hamburger" is something that the Croatian government (and perhaps the world as a whole) fears not out of disgust, but out of ignorance. Now in control of Bosnia, Omčo and his "horrible horrible spicy crazy Joker hamburger" shall encompass Bosnia and the entire Balkans in an orgy of madness and culinary professionalism."

 twrcroatia.1.t:0 "Night"
 twrcroatia.1.d:0 "For the people of Croatia, there is no longer such a thing as day. The sun no longer shines its bright rays, nor do the Croatians breathe freely. Though the time continues, and life goes on, it is not the same as it is elsewhere in the world. In Croatia, it is as if a terrible, endless night has been cast down onto these lands, forever cursing its people to an eternity of damnation.\n\nUnder the nearly decade-long rule of the Ustashe, there has been irrevocable change. Though there have long been ethnic conflicts between the Croats and the Serbs, the Ustashe has committed crimes of unspeakable scale. Many have fled eastwards, for Serbia, or northwards to Hungary. Countless more are not so fortunate to escape. The Jewish people, as well, have faced brutal crimes against them, their blood being the rain of the Croatian springtime - and their ashes the snow of the Croatian winter.\n\nThe partisans have been forced out of Croatia, retreating to Serbia and the mountains of eastern Bosnia. The Chetniks are holding out in the city of Visegrad, isolated and with little in terms of food or supply. There is nothing in Croatia, save for Ante Pavelic's Ustase. The sun no longer shines upon Croatia. There is nothing but the dark night, never to end."
 twrcroatia.1.a:0 "I heard the beast say, come and see. And I beheld."

 twrcroatia.2.t:0 "The Zagreb Uprising"
 twrcroatia.2.d:0 "This morning began as another day in Zagreb. A bubble of peace, isolated from the violence and chaos of the rest of Croatia. Where there were no camps, nor Ustashe soldiers hunting down Jews and Serbs. It was as peaceful as one could have it under the Ustashe.\n\nThe bubble of peace, however, was suddenly punctured by a car speeding towards the Poglavnik's palace. As it rammed through the gates, an explosion shook the earth, as the gate had been destroyed by a suicide bomber. Quickly, multiple partisans filed through, onto the palace grounds. Overpowering the guards, they went to find Ante Pavelic. The Poglavnik armed himself, and, along with his bodyguards, barricaded the stairwell, to keep the partisans at bay. A battle ended in the partisans coming up the stairs, only to see him jump from his window to the ground a story below.\n\nAs Pavelic hit the pavement, bleeding profusely and with broken legs from what he had endured, he found himself surrounded by partisans. His death would be short, with him not even managing to beg for mercy before he was filled with bullets. The partisans draped the flag of Yugoslavia down from the windows, chanting, "brotherhood and unity."\n\nThe Ustashe would not let this go on. Tank and bomber units were dispatched to quell the partisans. Zagreb was in a state of war unseen in nearly a decade. Though all partisans involved were killed, and Andrija Artukovic was declared Poglavnik that night, a message had been sent to the Croatian people that the Ustashe was not forever. Several riots have already broken out across the country, most prominently in Bosnian cities such as Sarajevo, Vishegrad, and Banja Luka."
 twrcroatia.2.a:0 "Croatia burns."
 
 twrcroatia.3.t:0 "A Midnight Putsch"
 twrcroatia.3.d:0 "It was pitch black outside. Zagreb had been suffering from widespread power outages since the insurgency began, but even as the dust settled it seemed as if Croatia had finally reverted back to the Dark Ages. The tranquil night sky was suddenly interrupted by a barrage of gunfire within the Croatian parliament as unidentified members of the Home Guard stormed the building with one goal in mind; coup d'etat. As room-to-room fighting quickly turned the typically dull building into a war zone, a small group of soldierss and the Putsch's leader finally made it to the Poglavnik's office. Busting the door down, they quickly found Andrija Artuković fubling around his desk trying to grab a gun. "Mladen!" he cried, looking at the man who stood before him. Mladen Lorković had long since tired of the late Poglavnik's repeated failures and to him Andrija was more of the same. Although a short, stubby man with no real charisma, Mladen Lorković was nonetheless a skilled negotiator that had managed to bring the army on his side in what many would see as High Treason. "I should've known it would've been a rat like you!" Artuković yelled, his trembling hand grabbing his gun and pointing it at Lorković. "You've made a grave mistake here Mladen... But i sure as hell won't give you anything to gloat over." He said, quickly putting the gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger."
 twrcroatia.3.a:0 "The sun rises on a new Croatia."
 
 twrcroatia.4.t:0 "Executions in Zagreb"
 twrcroatia.4.d:0 ""And today, we have... Franjo Tudjman." The commissar read aloud, clearly uninterested. The prison's courtyard was deserted by this point as all of its inmates had recently perished. The two prison guards opened a door and shoved their last prisoner out onto the grass. He was barely wearing anything, having been savagely beaten with little time for his blood to actually clot. Coughing with what little energy he had left, Tudjman looked up to see the bright sun blind him and the commissar's scowl towering over him. Picking up the prisoner and sitting him down on a single chair, the commissar pulled out his old pistol and put it right to Tudjman's head. "You are accused of high treason and conspiracy with communist forces. How do you plead?" Franjo looked at him square in the eye, smiled and spat in his face "Go to hell, fascist piece of shit." he murmured. Wiping the spit off his face, the commissar pulled the pin on his gun and put his finger on the trigger. "Sloboda Narodu." Tudjman said, looking straight into the gun's barrel. The commissar pulled the trigger, and Franjo's lifeless body fell to the ground. The chair and surrounding grass were stained with the late partisan's blood as the two guards picked up Franjo's corpse and carried it away."
 twrcroatia.4.a:0 "Resistance is futile."
 
 twrcroatia.5.t:0 "Croatia Requests Military Shipments"
 twrcroatia.5.d:0 "Our former allies in the Independent State of Croatia has requested our help in their latest campaign against the communist partisans that run rife throughout their nation. While their interests undoubtedly align with ours, our high command stresses that giving aid to subhuman Slavs while the Reich teeters on the brink of disaster may weaken Germany further. The decision however, ultimately rests with the Führer and his future plans for the Balkans."
 twrcroatia.5.a:0 "The Poglavnik will have our support."
 twrcroatia.5.b:0 "Who cares about Croatia?"
 
 twrcroatia.6.t:0 "Germany Sends Military Aid"
 twrcroatia.6.d:0 "Good news! Our old friends in Germany have agreed to send us the weapons we so desperately needed."
 twrcroatia.6.a:0 "Excellent."
 
 twrcroatia.7.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Send Aid"
 twrcroatia.7.d:0 "Terrible news! Our former benefactors in Germany have refused to send us the aid we need in continuing our pacification campaign! Citing rising tensions in the Reich as Hitler inches ever-closer to death, it would seem that this time the glorious Fuhrer of Germany has left us on our own for now."
 twrcroatia.7.a:0 "We will go on without them."
 
 twrcroatia.8.t:0 "Village Fire"
 twrcroatia.8.d:0 "The quiet darkness of night descended upon the village. The mothers, fathers, and children all went to bed, their fears dispelled by the light of the moon and the stars. The threat of an Ustashe attack disappeared, to return tomorrow. Yet, if one looked towards the hills, they would see the faint orange glow of the coming fire.\n\nCrossing over the hills into the valley below, the Croatian soldiers laid their eyes upon their target. An idyllic place, untouched by decades of war and terror. But looks would not save this village of Serbs. The soldiers armed themselves with their flamethrowers and out came waves of fire.\n\nPlumes of smoke rose into the air. The darkness was lit up with bright colours of red, orange, yellow and white. Some jumped out their windows to the ground below, the soldiers shooting them where they fell. They barricaded the doors, to make sure that no Serb could escape their punishment - one that had been willed by the Poglavnik, the people, and almighty God.\n\nThat night, as the Crusaders of a modern era departed, they heard the screams of the damned amongst the flames of an earthly Hell, and the village turned from wood to ash."
 twrcroatia.8.a:0 "Out of the heart of man come evil thoughts."
 
 twrcroatia.9.t:0 "Exile"
 twrcroatia.9.d:0 ""Are we there yet?" Mirko asked. They had been on the road for almost three hours now, having been forced to go on foot to wherever may take them. Little Mirko and his only surviving relative, his bigger sister Katarina had been forced from their home, just outside Visegrad, by the new Ustase campaign. Choosing to head east to Serbia, she hoped that maybe their estranged father would be there. "Quiet, rats!" The Black Legion soldier yelled behind them, prodding his still-warm gun into her backside. He was not much older than her, likely a new recruit given his trigger-happy attitude. Walking faster with Mirko in her arms, they continued onto what they hoped would be salvation.\n\nHow were they going to make money? Where were they going to find their papa? Was he even alive? They'd surely figure things out as time went on. Her thoughts on the future were interrupted as they walked around a bend and almost immediately she spotted an opportunity to escape. Extremely dense bushes are known hideouts for partisan ambushes, and in this part of Bosnia they were especially prevalent. Jumping into the bush, her gamble paid off.\n\nAs if on command, four men emerged from the bushes with automatic rifles in hand and quickly gunned down the young Croatian. Donning scruffy beards and Sajkaca caps, they were undoubtedly Chetniks. Saying very little to each other, Katarina and Mirko followed the men off the beaten path, to a village flying a flag that she almost never thought she'd see flying again; The black Chetnik standard alongside the royal flag of Yugoslavia."
 twrcroatia.9.a:0 "At last - a breath of freedom."
 
 twrcroatia.10.t:0 "Our Father"
 twrcroatia.10.d:0 "They were packed tightly into the chapel. Shivering and barely conscious, a group of about fifty people sat down in the makeshift pews. "Brothers and sisters, I'm so glad you could all make it today." The chaplain said. He received no reply outside of a cough or two. Friar Tomislav Filipovic was not unknown to his "congregation", a sadistic priest known to most as "Brother Satan", he had been tasked with the forced conversion of Serbs and Jews to Catholicism. A job which he did with brutal diligence. "I am disappointed to hear that many of you haven't yet seen the light of God, but there is still hope for you all yet. As a token of my generosity, I grant all of you a chance to repent before entering God's Kingdom." Motioning to the guards to lock the doors in the chapel, Friar Tomislav donned his gas mask, as lingering yellowish gas began flooding the room. Some people inside panicked and ran for the door, only to be fired upon by the now masked guards. Others huddled together quietly weeping, slowly turning into a hellish choir of coughing, gradually fading into quietness. Making the sign of the cross with his golden crucifix, Friar Tomislav began giving the suffocated remains of his victims their last rights, muffled by his mask."
 twrcroatia.10.a:0 "From ashes to ashes, from dust to dust."
 
 twrcroatia.11.t:0 "A Terrible Swarm Of Avengers"
 twrcroatia.11.d:0 ""On the ground!" Milos ordered. Five of the prisoners were forced onto the ground. Kneeling in front of their captor, their heads were forced onto the ground. commandant Ljubo Milos pulled out a crumpled piece of paper and adjusted his glasses to read it. He looked largely uninterested in the whole ordeal, sweating through his cap and having another hand on his gun. "You have been accused of collaborating with international Jewry, communist forces and robbery. In the power ordained in me as commandant you have all been sentenced to death by firing squad." Crumpling the paper and putting it back in his uniform pocket, the condemned glanced up and saw what would be their grave, a hastily-dug shallow pit just outside camp. It still had shovels in it from yesterday, and the bottom was already beginning to collect water and become muddy. "I SAID DOWN!" Milos barked, slitting one of the prisoner's throats and kicking him into the pit. "Guards, aim your rifles." the commandant said, looking towards the five soldiers which stood behind the remaining four prisoners. Milos looked at his watch, he was 15 minutes late to a luncheon with his bosses, and tardiness was something that was unacceptable in the Ustase High Command. Looking to quickly get this...minor delay over with, the commandant finally gave the order."
 twrcroatia.11.a:0 ""Ready, aim, fire.""
 
 twrcroatia.12.t:0 "The House"
 twrcroatia.12.d:0 "Franjo looked at the house. It was a nice-looking place, two stories and red siding. He looked at Marko. "What's the deal? It seems fine to me."\n\nMarko sighed. "A Jew family use' ta live here and the Ustashe didn't clean the place when they got done, so we gotta do it."\n\nAs they stepped inside, it became obvious why they were here. It was impossible to hide the trail of blood that came down the stairwell and descended into the basement. Some disgusting stench filled the air. Franjo was already cautious. "Are you sure there's nobody here?" he asked Marko, who nodded in response.\n\nThe first room was the kitchen, which was disturbingly grisly. Blood was smeared across the walls and floor, with two cutting knives on the floor. Before Franjo took a step, Marko stopped him. "Hey, hey, hey! Don't step in the glass!" When Franjo looked down, he saw the shards of... something glass all over the floor.\n\nNext came the basement. As they walked down the stairs, Franjo noticed the stench was even worse. And then, when he opened the door..."
 twrcroatia.12.a:0 "They found the family."
 
 twrcroatia.13.t:0 "The Lorkovic Trial"
 twrcroatia.13.d:0 "Mladen Lorković is a controversial figure in Croatian politics; Although an early follower and close friend of Pavelic, many of his theories are connsidered...a bit too radical to say the least. Although a firm believer in the state's racial policies, he is still considered by many to be a moderate and by extension a threat to the state's hardline positions. We will put Lorkovic on trial for seditious activities, and hopefully this growing thorn is snipped before it's too late."
 twrcroatia.13.a:0 "We eagerly await the traitor's fate."
 
 twrcroatia.14.t:0 "The Lorkovic Trial - Guilty"
 twrcroatia.14.d:0 "Good news from the courtroom today, the treasonous Mladen Lorković has confessed to the horrible crimes of undermining the state. As per state policy on the treatment of subversives, the sentence is death, to immediately be carried out by firing squad."
 twrcroatia.14.a:0 "If you do wrong, be afraid; he does not bear the sword in vain."
 
 twrcroatia.15.t:0 "The Lorkovic Trial - Not Guilty"
 twrcroatia.15.d:0 "Terrible news! Mladen Lorković has escaped the justice of our court systems by having his case dismissed altogether, undoubtedly bribing the judges involved."
 twrcroatia.15.a:0 "The rat escapes justice."
 
 twrcroatia.16.t:0 "Parliament Meets"
 twrcroatia.16.d:0 "For the first time since the Zagreb Uprising, the Croatian State Parliament has met in a hastily-convened emergency session. Immediately, Artukovic was officially and unanimously sworn in as the next Poglavnik, succeeding the recently-murdered Ante Pavelic.\n\nFrom there, however, the state of Parliament quickly descended into chaos, as Artukovic attempted to propose acts that would clamp down on what limited opposition remained, citing the possibility of several parliamentarians being involved in a conspiracy with Jews and freemasons to restore the rights of Serbs. Several HSS lawmakers walked out in protest, while others, along with multiple Bosniak MPs, berated their Ustashe counterparts, declaring that if the latter passed Artukovic's proposals, "Croatia would be torn apart."\n\nAfter a brawl between Ustashe and HSS members broke out on the floor of the State Parliament, a vote was finally called, resulting in a victory for all of the proposed acts. Though it is not, as Artukovic claimed, the Jews or masons, The highest levels of Croatia's government have been infiltrated - in truth, by the societal tensions that threaten to, as said by a Bosnian lawmaker, tear the country apart."
 twrcroatia.16.a:0 "Let us get to work."
 
 twrcroatia.17.t:0 "Rioting in Sarajevo"
 twrcroatia.17.d:0 "The death of the Poglavnik has shaken our state to the very core, and our precarious provinces in Bosnia are no exception. Likely being bought off by bolsheviks and Serbs, these rabblerousers have been calling for ridiculous requests like 'more rights' and 'self-determination'. These deviants must be dealt with immediately."
 twrcroatia.17.a:0 "Send in the Home Guard!"
 
 twrcroatia.18.t:0 "Bosnian MPs Pick Sides"
 twrcroatia.18.d:0 "With the future of the Croatian state uncertain, many Bosnians within parliament have become almost as restless as the protestors in Mostar and Sarajevo. with all of them opposing any further action against their riotous brethren. Without any actual progress made after six hours of what sounded more like a seedy tavern than a national parliament, the session subsequently ended without anything accomplished and the Bosnian politicians quickly leaving Zagreb at a suspiciously-quick pace."
 twrcroatia.18.a:0 "Why didn't we hang them when we had the chance?"
 
 twrcroatia.19.t:0 "Bosnian Independence Declared"
 twrcroatia.19.d:0 "The Independent State of Croatia's greatesst test has finally come; Citing years of mistreatment under the Ustase despite being considered equal citizens on paper, Mehmed Handžić, the informal spiritual and political leader of the Sarajevo ulema announced on the radio that the Bosnian people have chosen to finally pursue their own destiny after decades of servitude to others. Already, reports of militiamen loyal to an independent Bosnia have seized armouries and began expelling Ustase politicians. In response to this act of high treason, Andrija Artukovic has declared the revolt a 'Lawless rabble funded by jewry' and mobilized the Home Guard against the revolt."
 twrcroatia.19.a:0 "Za dom spremni!"
 
 twrcroatia.20.t:0 "What Was Once a Village"
 twrcroatia.20.d:0 "Amar rode his way home from the battlefield upon a horse. Traversing fields and valleys for days, he longed for that which he had missed in the heat of battle. Fighting for Bosnia had brought about a most dreary homesickness - one which could only be quenched by returning to the place he had been born, grown up, and still lived. He had not served in the invasion of Yugoslavia, and was ambivalent in regards to Ustashe rule. When the bugle call of Bosnia rang out, however, he answered.\n\nYet, he could not help but worry. He had heard tales of the Ustashe burning down villages in response to their men going to war against them. Although he dismissed these worries as unfounded and assured himself that there was little reason for concern, he was met with a different sight upon arrival.\n\nFrom the trees hung the corpses of the dead, filled with bullets. The torched remains of houses still dotted the landscape, touched by nothing since terror had reared its ugly head. Amar looked around, struck with the pangs of an indescribable emotion. The mutilated bodies that laid upon the ground and among the trees were not just the nameless, unknown comrades that he had seen on the battlefield. They were his friends. His neighbours. His wife and his daughter - victims of unspeakable horrors in their own right.\n\nThe village that Amar had once called home was no more."
 twrcroatia.20.a:0 ""My occupied homeland, trampled village, my home...""
 
 twrcroatia.21.t:0 "Partisan Execution"
 twrcroatia.21.d:0 "So, Alija thought, this was going to be how his life ended. Not as a hero of the country, dying of old age in some old folks' home, but amongst the trees of Perucica. The Ustashe had found him atop a tree, shooting down at them from the canopies. At first, he had been pretty good at shooting back, getting them and dodging out of the way. However, all it took was one bullet to make its way through his leg, and he had fallen to the ground. Now, here he was, bruised, scratched up, bleeding, and about to be the victim of an impromptu execution.\n\nOne of the soldiers took photographs of him, moving around, unspeaking. "Just kill me already," Alija growled, pointing his rifle at the photographer, "If you're going to take pictures, have it be my body." One of the more unkempt soldiers glared at him, before being held back by his (apparently higher-ranking) comrade. "It's fine, we won't kill you," he said, "But tell us something first."\n\n"Wait, what? Uh, fire away." Alija said, smiling. The Croatian looked at him for a second, before dryly replying, "Ha-ha, very funny. Anyways, where are your friends?" The Bosnian partisan looked at him for a second. "What?"\n\nShooting the rebel in his other leg, the Croatian continued, "I said, 'where are your friends?'. After all, I doubt it's just you fighting." Looking up to him, grinding his teeth in pain, Alija groaned, sort of singing, as if he was part of a demented church chorus, "Nobody else! I grabbed my gun and went to war!" The Ustashe soldier sighed, "Well, we'll just leave you here, then," before shooting Alija once again, this time in the back.\n\nWatching the Ustashe disappear into the woods, Alija screamed at them, "Come back! Come back and kill me, you bastards! Don't just leave me here!" Clenching his teeth. He could do nothing, now. Both of his legs were gone, as was his spine. He couldn't move, except crawl on his elbows. All he could do was wait for the wild or the weather to take him - whichever came first."
 twrcroatia.21.a:0 "Death to partisans."
 
 twrcroatia.22.t:0 "Mountain Execution"
 twrcroatia.22.d:0 "Marko stared at the captured partisans, and saw each face looking back at him. A dozen or so captured souls, each staring back at him, with a mix of contempt and dull fear. They were Bosnian POWs, their base atop the mountain destroyed by an ambush. The Ustashe troops each were discussing what to do with the rebels, and Marko, as their commander, had to decide what to do with them. Thinking to himself for a bit, he came to a conclusion. "Kill them," he said abruptly to his adjutant, "Tell them to do what they please."\n\nHis adjutant saluted, and shouted the orders to the soldiers under them. Hearing their orders, the Home Guard began a transformation, like that of werewolves in old folklore, turning from mere men of war to beasts and monsters. The more merciful ones used bayonets between the ribs, as they had been taught. Others used such weapons without care of where they went on their victims, or used rocks, petrol bombs, or other methods of brute force to extinguish the life of their victims.\n\nThey made quick work of them. Within a few minutes, the only lives left on the mountain were Croatians. Seeing the aftermath, Marko remarked a few things to his adjutant, before they began their descent down the mountain and back to the road, as the hunt for Bosnians continued."
 twrcroatia.22.a:0 "No mercy."
 
 twrcroatia.23.t:0 "Falling Down"
 twrcroatia.23.d:0 "Atop the mountain, the last few survivors of the raid had been captured. Their camp had been attacked by the Ustashe, throwing petrol bombs without any warning. Only three had been left alive, and they were now being interrogated.\n\n"Please," the first one to be interrogated sobbed, "Let me go, brothers. I have only been roped into this fight by my friends. I know that we are the same people! Do not kill me, I have a wife at home! Please, brothers, I beg of you!" Laughing, the Croatian soldiers mocked him. "You're like a revolving door," one of them said, "Turning to whatever side is best for you!" Not accepting the soldier's argument, the brutes grabbed him by the legs and pulled him to the edge of the cliff.\n\nThe soldier shrieked in terror as he was held over the edge of the mountain. "Brothers, please!" he yelled out, "I fought for you against Serbia! We believe in the same things; death to anyone who is against Croatia! Please, do not kill me! I'll tell you anything!" The Ustashe soldiers, rather than listening to his pleas, poured some water down into his mouth and nose, and howled in monstrous laughter as they watched him suffer, and then, after whispering to themselves and coming up with an agreement, they released him.\n\nThe beasts watched silently as the soldier fell down the mountain. It was not, by any means, a clean fall from the top to the bottom, but a rough, rocky one. And then, when they were sure he was dead, they returned to the remaining two, their lust for blood quenched."
 twrcroatia.23.a:0 "The monsters come like rain, down from the mountains into the valleys below."
 
 twrcroatia.24.t:0 "The Headless Imam"
 twrcroatia.24.d:0 "The imam had been cornered.\n\nOn the field of battle, his fellow soldiers were strewn about, either having been sent from this world into the next or still groaning and writhing in pain, left to suffer at the hands of the Croatian terror. Yet he alone had been left alive and unharmed - either by act of Allah or by the hands of the Home Guard. Yet, within the back of his mind, the imam could not help but feel that living was perhaps something not always so great. Perhaps it was seeing his comrades moaning for their mothers on the ground, or the more selfish reason that he was in the Croatians' hands.\n\nThe soldiers of the Home Guard were brash and uncouth, frequently cutting the imam with their knives and brandishing their weapons at him, showing little regard for if he lived or perished. They joked amongst themselves of performing horrors against the Bosnian people; raping their women, killing their children, burning their mosques, and much more - all, unfortunately, exactly what the imam expected of such brutes.\n\nAnd then one of them spoke to his brothers in whispered tones, pointing back to the imam and making a slicing motion with his hand. To the imam's concern, the others nodded in agreement as they began to approach him. Slowly they came, smiling like the devils they were. The last words the imam heard were simple. "You'll look nice hanging on a mantle!" Before a roar of laughter and the swipe of a machete across his neck."

And while we can deal with a shortage of tanks or planes, we are in no position to fight without guns.\n\nSo, we have begun to bring in weaponry for our struggle. Many of these guns have been taken through quasi-legal methods, such as bribery and the black market. Fortunately, however, we have managed to buy plenty of other weapons through perfectly legal methods. With these arms, we shall bring control back over Bosnia, and restore our rule!"

 twrcroatia.27.d:0 "Ahmad sighed, exhaling the fumes from his cigarette. A temporary break in the fighting had begun, so here he was, sitting in the trench alongside his comrades. And then, from the sky, he heard the buzzing of a plane - that of the Croatian Air Force. Taking cover, along with everyone else in the trench, they waited for the detonation of the bombs, the rain of dirt. And yet, there was nothing. Nothing more than a few leaflets dropped from the sky.\n\nLooking at the thin, orange paper, Ahmad could not help but chuckle. "Well?" the soldier next to him inquired, "What does it say?" Smiling still, Ahmad read it out loud; "We both agree, death to Jews - let us join forces, smash a brick into their ugly skulls!" Looking around, he found that his fellow fighters did not see it the same way. "They're right, you know," one of them said, "You and I both know that those Jews are the reason things are so bad in the first place."\n\n"You're insane," Ahmad laughed, "They're going to kill us, too. Just like the Jews." The other soldier turned to him, stating plainly, "And what's so bad with that? It didn't matter to me." And then, with his comrades watching in shock, the soldier climbed out of the trench, hands raised, surrendering himself over to the Home Guard."

Her son responded, begging, "But please, Mama! I'll be careful!"\n\nHis mother was exasperated, but thought to herself for a moment: she could finally get some time to cook dinner without being pestered every other moment. "Fine," she said, "But take your big brother out with you."\n\n"Yay!" Vedad cried out, "Come on, Ivan, let's go!" As the two left to go play outside, their mother couldn't help but be worried, even as she cooked the chicken uninterrupted. What if something happened to them out there? There could be soldiers, mines, unexploded bombs, everything that could possibly hurt them! She couldn't take it! They had to come back in.\n\nBefore the mother could get outside to call them in, however, she heard an explosion, as the ground seemed to shake. Rushing outside as fast as she could, she called for her boys. "Ivan! Vedad! Come here!" No response. Walking around to search for them, she nearly threw up when she saw their bodies. They had been struck directly by the bomb.\n\nTurning her head upwards, she screamed in anguish as a mother of nobody, and saw the Croatian bomber fly off."

She looked over to her husband, grinning from ear to ear. "Bosnia is free," she said, barely able to contain her excitement, "the reign of terror is over, at last!" They could already hear the fireworks pounding in the sky above, for no longer would they be ruled by Croatians, but by fellow Bosniaks.\n\nThough Bosnia has been exuberant over their newfound freedom, in Croatia, there is a feeling of anger and betrayal. All flags have been flown at half-staff, and the nation has officially entered a state of mourning. The horizon looks grim for the Ustashe government - can they hold on, or is a regime change on the cards?"

He understood. Dark clouds were once more over the Bosnian horizon, and the dream of fresh air had been cast away - perhaps forever.\n\nBosnia weeps, for Croatia has proven victorious. With the Ustashe victory, cooperation has become a distant memory. Already, a reign of terror has begun, and rumours of torched villages, of mountains of the dead have begun to make the rounds. The Ustashe has secured their shaky government, for now.\n\nCroatia has triumphed, and her enemies have fallen aside! Long live the Poglavnik! Long live Croatia! Death to her enemies!

Wasting no time in condemning the late Ante Pavelic and his gangsters, many within the clergy have become outspoken critcs against "anti-Croat Nazism" and have even gone so far as to demand the excommunication of any and all Croatians who still follow the Ustase's banner.

 twr_cro_downfall.1.d:0 "Miroslav Navratil had decided that it was time to go. He knew that, if the enemy were to reach him, then he would most certainly be shot or hanged. He had to get out of the country, starting with Zara. He would get to Malta, and then a flight to South America. Paraguay, perhaps?\n\nAs the propeller began to turn, Navratil thought more about who would take him in. There was always the possibility of claiming that he was opposed to the Ustase. He could put on a sorrowful face as he claimed that he was unaware of the true scope of the genocide. Surely, they would believe him - he had been told he was a very convincing liar.\n\nCrossing the country and moving towards Zara, Navratil noticed that fuel was running very low. He would have to make a landing somewhere close by. According to his estimates, he must have been close to the Kornati archipelago. He was free!\n\nThen, the plane ran out of fuel and went into a nosedive. Navratil panicked, and as the plane plunged towards the ground, he said his final prayers before he perished."

He heard his voice echo, and waited - only to receive no response. As the young man left the holy building, Petar Brzica could once more breathe easily, at last free from those hunting him down.\n\nAs Brzica prayed to the altar of Christ, he heard an artillery shell fall outside, followed by shouting. He chucked quietly. These soldiers could not even aim straight. His train of thought was interrupted, however, by another shell firing - followed by a loud explosion, as the church shook from the impact.\n\nBrzica heard a crash from behind, and found that rubble had fallen in front of the door, trapping him within. Next came another shell, and part of the right side of the church caved in, nearly killing the commander if he had not gotten out of the way in time. As one more shell fell, he looked upwards, and heard another boom, taking the southwestern corner with it. The ceiling fell upon Petar Brzica -  and this time, there was no escape, as he was entombed within the church's ruins."

 twr_cro_downfall.3.d:0 ""Who are we looking for, anyways?" the first soldier whispered to his officer. Turning to his comrade, he quietly responded, "Pavicic, black hair, long face. Can't miss him." Handing over a photo of the Ustashe commander over to his lower-ranking comrade, the two nodded in understanding - as if to say, "Yes, I know who I'm looking for".\n\nThe office complex was a wreck. Continuous shelling, bombing, and battle had riddled the building with holes, and everything was in disarray. The two saw the door to his office. Kicking it down with brute force, they entered with their guns to find... nobody. The room was deserted, and evidently in a hurry, as many documents were strewn about, with an aura of chaos in the room.\n\nThough they looked through the whole building, the whole city, Viktor Pavicic was not there - he was not anywhere. He was gone, without a trace of his existence. He had vanished from the earth with such a fashion as if it was as if he had never been in the first place."

Croatia was lost - he was smart enough to know that. But then what? He surely would be captured and executed, no matter what he said. He did not want to be taken captive and slaughtered by a bunch of Jewish Bolsheviks, Serbs, and masons, that was for sure.\n\nLuburić knew what he had to do. He would not let them take him alive and kill him - he would kill himself, instead. He imagined their happiness to be capturing him, only to find his body! Luburić couldn't help but laugh to himself at the thought.\n\nHe aimed his pistol into his mouth, and pulled. So came Vjekoslav Luburić's demise - instant and splattered upon a wall by his own hand."

It did not mean much to him, however, for he had done it for the good of Croatia - one that was being snuffed out before his very eyes. They would see what he had done. They would see him among the ashes and execute him. It did not matter to Milos, though. Croatia would rise again, like a great and terrible phoenix.\n\nAs he lined the inmates up, he stared upon them - their pitiful, starving bodies. He took hold of his rifle, and decided to inspect one of them. Laughing at and mocking the shivering skeleton of a man, he eventually struck the inmate with a bayonet. As he did so, he heard a scream come from his right, and was pushed to the ground.\n\nWhat followed was a cacophony of violence, as those who were to be slaughtered rose up against the slaughterers. With an orgy of gunfire and blood enveloping him, the last thing Ljubo Milos saw was the barrel of a gun."

Croatia was in a state of chaos - former Ustase soldiers now ran amok, killing Serbs, Jews, Muslims, everyone they disliked while they still held power. As others defected and turned tail, Jure Francetić led his troops to fight their way to the mountains, where they would continue to fight.\n\nHis men were dying around him, their blood puddling around their leader. Yet still, the soldiers fought on. Eventually, however, they became sick of seeing their comrades die at the hands of Francetić. They spoke to each other in hushed tones, and one by one, they stopped firing and aimed their weapons upon their commander.\n\nFrancetić quickly realised what was happening. He tried to reason with them, saying that they would live on to fight in the mountains. Then, he became enraged, shouting at them that they would all be executed by the government if they tried to kill him. Finally, he pleaded with them, begging for his life to be spared.\n\nYet the soldiers paid little mind to his babbling. After he was done, one soldier asked if he had any last words. Francetić spoke quietly, a gravelly voice saying, "I have done everything to breathe the air of a free Croatia."\n\nSo ended the life of Jure Francetić."

 twr_cro_flavour.1.d:0 "Almost every day, Ivan would ride his bike outside of town into the woods. There, he would find a hoopoe. The hoopoe was trapped between tree branches, yet it still chirped. Often, Ivan would speak to the bird, asking questions that he knew the bird could not answer. Still, he enjoyed the calm that it brought him, and it enjoyed his soothing voice - enough for it to stop thrashing in the branches.\n\nEvery day, the hoopoe became smaller. Trapped between branches, it had nothing to eat. Its body became smaller and its wings weaker. Soon, it stopped trying to flap them. The bird thrashed less each day, as its chirps turned to cries. Ivan did not understand at first, but eventually he learned. Yet, there was nothing he could do, with the tree stretching so high. He left, promising to return.\n\nEarly the next morning, the hoopoe's breathing grew weaker. Its eyes closed, and its beak followed with them. Some crows flew by, and picked at the dead bird, eventually tearing it apart and carrying the parts as they flew away. When Ivan came to the forest, he looked for the hoopoe. Seeing nothing, he got back on his bike and returned home."

Amongst the other villagers, he was always sharing tales, both ancient and recent, of injustices against the Serbians. It was always someone else, be it the Turks, the Greeks, the Austrians, the Hungarians, the Germans, or the Croatians. He spoke every day of how he missed the king, and when the Serbs had their place in the sun as the masters of the Balkans.\n\nAnd then, one day, Marko left for Visegrad, on a family visit. And then he was gone. Plenty of stories went around, ranging from the mundane, such as him having been killed, to the more unrealistic, such as him joining the Chetniks or the partisans in Serbia, to the whimsical, such as him having left for Italy or America. Nobody knew where Marko was, or if he was alive at all, but few believed he still lived in Croatia.\n\nAnd then, one day, Marko was back. But it was not the same Marko as the old days. He was thin and bruised, and looked as if he had aged thirty years. He no longer spoke about anything. Not the Turks, not the Serbians, not history. One day, one of the villagers, Dunja, walked up to the amateur historian and asked, "Marko, what happened when you were in Visegrad?"\n\n"They burned it all," Marko said, his eyes staring through Dunja with the chill of icicles, "They slaughtered us like we were nothing but pigs. I ran away, I ran away! But I've already seen it all, I'm telling you. We can't talk about the old days, when it's happening right before us!""

However, the dockyards of these lands are not made for fearsome navies, but for merchants, who sail the Mediterranean in search of profits.

The Regia Marina will not run us over, for the Croatian Navy will be able to put up a strong fight - one just like David and Goliath.

 CRO_The_Croatian_Army_desc:0 "The Croatian Army has gone far since its founding with our independence in 1941. Still, however, there are many things which continue to hold it back. The primary issue, besides a lack of professionalism, is a lack of modern equipment. Most of our units continue to use German, or worse, Austro-Hungarian rifles. Another problem emerges in the fact that our army has not yet made for itself a single doctrine, instead focusing more on such matters as killing Jews and Serbs. If we hope to be feared by more people than defenceless civilians, we must modernise our armed forces - and fast, for the horizon looks grim if we do not."

Unfortunately, however, a divide has already formed over how this modernisation will happen. Many support expanding our usage of artillery and building an experienced core of troops. On the other hand, more radical voices have proposed building up our armoured forces and mechanising our troops. Which way shall it be?"

Using technological advancements, we are now able to pump out shells and guns at numbers never seen before.

Instead of taking ideas from a completely foreign country, we must look to something more familiar; the invasion of Yugoslavia.

The primary focus of the Germans' blitzkrieg doctrine, used in Poland, France, the Low Countries, and Yugoslavia, is a rapid breakthrough of enemy forces, followed by encirclement. In order to fully realise the potential of this doctrine, we must give further autonomy to tank division commanders. These commanders, akin to Germany's great generals such as Rommel and Manstein, will lead Croatia to victory through speed - our very own blitzkrieg."

This will ensure the ability to have a large number of planes able to take off at the right time - not only to protect the furthest border regions, but to take to the skies if we are under attack by foreign foe. The airfield is, all in all, an invaluable resource to any air force worth its weight, and we will need more of them to have a chance in the sky."

 CRO_Bomber_Programme_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our Air Force is dominated by antiquated bombers, dating all the way back to the Balkan Wars and the First World War. With short ranges and no ability to drop reasonable loads, we need to start anew and by funding a programme our bombers. With this, we can hope to help speed along funding for new bombers. Upgraded and new bomber planes will allow us to increase our offensive capability from the air and make offensives easier for our infantry, knowing that the skies belong to them."

Fortunately, they are not as in bad condition as our bombers, as well as being made after 1914 - not to say that they are much better. If we were to get in a fight with another nation, they would be shot down in seconds.

Since independence, we have struggled to keep anything resembling an economy afloat, while other nations have managed to succeed and prosper at least a little bit. Croatian leadership has accused many different groups of being responsible for it - Jews, Bolsheviks, Roma, Serbs, and so on and so on.

However, instead of advocating for an industrial society, we must support our nation's great farmers. They are the strongest members of society, always rolling with the punches that they are dealt, be it from the Serbs, the Bolsheviks, the Jews, or the rich.

The poor men of Croatia are just as patriotic as the rich, but the fact is that they did not make deals with the devil to fatten their pockets.

But with the rebellion finally over, the question of what do with these territories and their autonomous status now remains in jeopardy as many in the government wish to rule the region directly from Zagreb or to placate the muslim population.
