SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Spain stands today, almost 15 years since the end of the Spanish Civil War, united under its great dictator Francisco Franco, leader of the military junta and of the national movement, the only legally allowed party of the Spanish State. Most of the former Republican menace has either vanished, been purged or has gone to exile, leavin Spain relatively stable. With the nazi victory in Europe and Africa, Spain was able to quickly take Morocco from the Free French Forces, comparable to a vulture eating from a rotting animal, and established a Spanish protectorate. Spain now stands on the verge of colonial conflict, as the Moroccan project has been ignored for too long."
TWR_FRANCO:0 "Francisco Franco, known by his Spanish allies as the Caudillo of Spain, has ruled the unstable state for around a decade now. The dictator, having been rather succesfull in establishing his base of power, has yet to settle down into his power, still fearing republican treachery and seeing danger in the growing student population of Spain. \nFranco, as a former soldier and commander in the Rif war, has had a general interest in the Berber-Arabic region of Morocco, making the Moroccan project his passion project, wanting to fulfill it before the end of 1952. Franco has put much into the project, promoting it as a prestige project for the entire Spanish state, comparable to the inquisition and reconquista. He happily awaits the day that Morocco becomes a core Spanish region."
BLANCO_DESC:0 "Luis Carrero Blanco, known as The Most Excellent among the Cortes, was born on the 4th of march, 1904, in Santoña, Cantabria. He entered the Naval Military Academy at the age of 14 and participated in the infamous Rif War, making him part of the old nationalist gaurd. When the civil war broke out, Blanco was able to reach the nationalist frontline by taking his refuge in the embassy of Mexico and later in the embassy of France. At the end of the civil war, Blanco had planted himself as one of Franco's closest allies, becoming the chief of naval operations. His power would become a major tool for the Opus Dei in the Franco government, as he aspired to closer economic integration with the European markets, though never outright becoming a proponent of liberalization. As a devout catholic, Blanco is seen by many as the perfect succesor of Franco, though some question his decision-making skills when facing pressure."
SUAREZ_DESC:0 "Adolfo Suárez has become a major figure for Spanish liberals. One of the few figureheads of the disunited student movement, the young Suarez has been a proponent of liberal democracy at a slow pace for a long time. Having studied law at the Salamanca university, he got into politics at a rather young age. While he's a major figure in the student movement, he's currently only appointed as the transitional head of state for Spain, prior to the first student congress, which will appoint a democratically elected president."

While most support Prince Xavier, many also support Prince Jaimie of the line of the former king of Spain, Alfonso XIII. This split played a huge role in our inability to unite against Franco and his personal ambitions. Even still some call Xavier's ascendancy to the throne illegitimate, it's clear a drastic change to the laws of succession is required to secure our power base."

SPA_Crownn_Jaime_Instead:0 "Crown Alfonso Instead"
SPA_Crownn_Jaime_Instead_desc:0 "Don Juan must be put to the side, but we cannot leave the throne vacant. Don Juan has two sons, his eldest is Juan Carlos.

SPA_falangist_crackdown_desc:0 "The 'Dia del Olvido' (Spanish for Day of Forgetting) is a term used to describe the period of high violence against the old Falangist order by the student movement. Many former falangist members were punched on the streets by anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists. Several women were dragged out of their houses and shaved as to humiliate their falangist ties. While the central movement has tried to stop such actions, they've also helped rid us of the falangist order and culture present in Spain."
SPA_redraw_the_communities:0 "Política de Perdonar"
SPA_redraw_the_communities_desc:0 "The Política de Perdonar (Spanish for Policy of Forgiving) is the policy proposed by the left and Catalan wing of the student movement, proposing the redrawing of the old administrative borders as a sign of forgiveness towards Spain's internal minorities, such as the Basques, Galicians and Catalans. The policy also includes the unification of the Basque states, as they were divided in terms of political freedom during the Franco regime, favoring the provinces that rose up against the republic."
SPA_rewrite_the_constitution:0 "Rewrite the Francoist Constitution"
SPA_rewrite_the_constitution_desc:0 "Spain's current constitution is an ugly remnant of the reactionary and authoritarian past, written to legitimise the power held by the autocrat.

SPA_continue_centralized_governance:0 "Centralize Power to Madrid"
SPA_continue_centralized_governance_desc:0 "A truly stable state must be centralised. While our new republic remains young and unstable, and the collapse of the old order has led to unofficial local governments to spring up, we must do all we can to keep power centralised with us in Madrid. Subversives and those who would betray our new government in the peripheral regions of Spain cannot be allowed to prosper, and we must be able to mobilise all the resources of the state to build a new system. The regional unofficial governments will be abolished - they are only a weakness."
SPA_maoist_resurgence_in_spain:0 "Inspired by Stalin"
SPA_maoist_resurgence_in_spain_desc:0 "Many see Stalin's rule as a failure, a corrupt tyrant whose dictatorship was unable to repel the German invaders. These people are wrong.

However, Stalin's form of socialism was very successful, and will serve as a model for our own country to follow."
SPA_dissolve_the_military_police:0 "Crush the Policía Armada"
SPA_dissolve_the_military_police_desc:0 "The Policía Armada, or 'the grey ones', are a horrible legacy of Francoism.

SPA_acknowledge_catalan_suffering_desc:0 "The people of Catalonia had to suffer under the Franco regime for far too long! having little to no political freedom and being forced to speak Castillian Spanish, the people of Catalonia have lost more in 20 years culturally than Spain has lost in 100 years. Thus, we'll grant the region of Catalonia a special status inside Spain, as a gesture of good faith."
SPA_appoint_a_chairman:0 "Republic of Minorities"
SPA_appoint_a_chairman_desc:0 "For too long, the minorities of Spain have been suppressed under the Francoist government.

SPA_secret_service_expansion:0 "Expand Espionage Efforts"
SPA_secret_service_expansion_desc:0 "Thought we should secure a good, professional army, we should also take preventative measures. Our intelligence department is perhaps the most lacking in this respect, therefore we should fund it more and enlist the help of spys."

SPA_support_the_military_police_desc:0 "Espionage is not enough. We will need a dedicated, professional and highly discreet spy system.

SPA_armed_forces_sabotage:0 "Intelligence Bureau Expansion"
SPA_armed_forces_sabotage_desc:0 "All of our prior intelligence reforms are quite minor in scale. Therefore, to completely overhaul our system and put the final nail in this project, we should expand our entire intelligence bureau and reach our arms everywhere we can."
SPA_surpression_tactics:0 "Razor Blades and Cigarettes Tactics"
SPA_surpression_tactics_desc:0 "A lot of our power will come from the simple presence of our military, or the threat of it. Therefore, we should prepare our soldiers both mentally as well as logistically for long stays, possible even overseas."

SPA_expand_the_air_force:0 "Expand Air Forces"
SPA_expand_the_air_force_desc:0 "Our air force is what is truly lacking, not the infantry. It is outdated and decrepit, therefore we should seek to purchase newer and better planes as well as overall train and supply a larger air force. "
SPA_nationalize_arms_factories:0 "Nationalize More Factories"

SPA_german_example:0 "The German Example"
SPA_german_example_desc:0 "Currently, we have no real air doctrine. We simply fly as needed. However, in creating a more austere air force, we can learn from the Germans Luftwaffe during the war to train and teach our pilots on effective air policy."

SPA_rocket_based_fighters_desc:0 "ith our air force on par with most of the worlds, it's time to begin construction of our on jetfighters. This way we can propel ourselves into the second half of the 20th century properly, as well as truly have a modern, Spanish air force."

SPA_spanish_armada:0 "Reorganize the Navy"
SPA_spanish_armada_desc:0 "Just as wars in Europe showed the importance of a powerful land army, the Pacific war showed the need for any capable power to have an effective navy. Unfortunately, our own naval forces leave much to be desired, with both strategies and vessels often being out of date. If we are to keep up and defend our shores, we must move forward with the times."
SPA_coastal_defensive_effort:0 "Learn from the Atlantik Wall"
SPA_coastal_defensive_effort_desc:0 "The German ‘Atlantic Wall' defences may have never been completed to the extent that they were once planned for, but nonetheless they are the clearest examples of modern coastal defences.

SPA_recover_the_navy:0 "Rebuild the old Navy"
SPA_recover_the_navy_desc:0 "Unfortunately, for some time now, Spain's navy has not been the envy of the world - other European powers like Britain, France, Italy and Germany have outmatched us.

SPA_embrace_the_old_german_doctrine:0 "Embrace Rudeltaktik"
SPA_embrace_the_old_german_doctrine_desc:0 "The unfortunate fact is, we cannot hope to have a deep water fleet which can match those of the great sea powers. That said, the Germans have shown how to combat these kinds of naval forces with fewer resources, concentrating on packs of submarines to sneak past blockades and intercept shipping. We should emulate this."
SPA_embrace_the_american_doctrine:0 "Embrace the American Doctrine"
SPA_embrace_the_american_doctrine_desc:0 "There has been no more spectacular a naval victory in recent times than that of the United States over the Japanese during the Pacific War.

SPA_small_ships_long_reach:0 "Increase our Global Reach"
SPA_small_ships_long_reach_desc:0 "A true naval power must have a deep water fleet that can project power across all corners of the world. Though it will be very costly, we should concentrate our resources on getting to this level of naval power projection, so that we can truly defend our interests across the whole globe and stand eye to eye against the great naval powers of the world."
SPA_colonial_naval_cooperation_plan:0 "Naval-Colonial Protection Initiative"
SPA_colonial_naval_cooperation_plan_desc:0 "Our colonial territories are excessively vulnerable to any attack by a greater naval power. We must make sure that our fleet has sufficient strength and range to defend all our territories from any potential attack. A Naval-Colonial Protection Initiative will be begun to this end, to defend all parts of Spain's empire from those who would want to attack it."
SPA_transport_and_trade_benefits:0 "Transporte y Comercio"
SPA_transport_and_trade_benefits_desc:0 "Maritime transport is a key part of our logistical network, especially when transporting troops and supplies between metropolitan Spain and the North African colonies.

SPA_submarine_warfare:0 "Expand upon the Wolfpacks"
SPA_submarine_warfare_desc:0 "The submarines are where the greatest opportunity for success lie. Lying nearly invisible under the waves, avoiding detection and striking at convoys and enemy surface vessels without warning, submarines are the future of asymmetric naval warfare, and we must focus all our resources on this field."
SPA_copy_plan_Z:0 "Expand upon Plan Z"
SPA_copy_plan_Z_desc:0 "Ultimately, having a large submarine fleet is not enough. There must also be a capable surface fleet to go alongside it, which the Germans have to some extent shown with their naval expansion program. We should follow in their footsteps."

SPA_free_the_unions:0 "Cooperate with the CNT"
SPA_free_the_unions_desc:0 "The CNT, a confederation of Spanish trade unions, can be a valuable ally. If we give them some concessions, some token gestures of giving them power, improve the conditions of workers, perhaps even install some of our people within their leadership, they can become a powerful backer of our regime."
SPA_end_church_politics:0 "End of Christian Power"
SPA_end_church_politics_desc:0 "Marx was right when he called religion the opium of the people.

SPA_formation_to_party:0 "Loyalty to the Party"
SPA_formation_to_party_desc:0 "For the revolution to succeed, the party must be unhindered in its efforts by petty partisan politics. Loyalty to the party must be prioritised above all else. Those who are loyal will be rewarded, those who are not loyal will meet a less pleasant fate."

SPA_greater_dockyards_desc:0 "Apart from being an economic asset, the Canaries are also a very important point of power projection for us. In order to increase the islands' relative geopolitical and strategic c significance, we should improve its naval infrastructure."
SPA_subsidize_tropical_agriculture:0 "Subsidize Banana Export"

SPA_placate_the_franco_loyalists_desc:0 "The rise to power of Francisco Franco was carefully planned out, yet seemed so aggressive in its cementing of Franco as a personality. Many people inside the cabinet clearly like the charmastic leader of Spain and to keep them on our good side is most important."
SPA_placate_the_carlists_desc:0 "The Traditionalists of Spain have generally rallied under the carlist flag, opposing progressive change or conservative status quo. They favour a return to the good old days of Spain prior to the republic and its change in social norms and have become a major party inside the Movement which we will have to deal with eventually."
SPA_placate_the_monarchists_desc:0 "The Spanish Civil War led to a huge stream of monarchists rallying the nationalist banner against the republic, as they saw their chance of restoring the old kingdom. Their monarchist sympathies are still felt across Spain, yet they're far from an aggressive force in Spanish politics, compared to the falangists and carlists."
SPA_placate_the_catholics_desc:0 "The Christian Catholic Church of Spain has been a major pillar for the Francoist regime since the beginning of the uprising of 1936, as the anti-clerical republic basically shoved most christians into the arms of the nationalist side. While the church is far from unified on the issue of Franco, the church is a clearly unifying force for Spain as a whole."
SPA_placate_the_falangists_desc:0 "The Azules, also known as the Falangists, have been a major party inside the National Movement.

To further defuse their recent zeal, we will make Morocco, in name, Falangist. Various ministries and political centres within the new territory will be given Falangist names. Franco will tacitly approve of National Syndicalism when it comes to Morocco and once more, Falangists will get some middling authority throughout Spanish Morocco.

SPA_Military_education_desc:0 "The people of Spain must always be ready for war. It is a sign of a weak nation if the people appeal to such pathetic ideas as those of 'peace'.

Clearly, events have shown that a large part of the population of our country desires either western liberal democracy or some other form of governmental reform. While we have no intention of renouncing our control on power, some trinket 'reforms' would help our image. Controlled small-scale elections and a slight loosening of political restrictions, within acceptable bounds, would go a long way."
SPA_reconstruct_spanish_society_desc:0 "Franco has tainted Spain with the ideology of falangism. His influence has its roots in Spanish society and should be undone if we want to reorganize Spain into a model republic."

Time and time again they attempt to undermine the Spanish State and place their fraudulent pretenders on the throne. But importantly there is an element of the Carlist movement which do support our line of succession. This element of the movement should receive our official support, perhaps we may placate the rest of the Carlists in the process."

Hundreds were camped along the roads; hundreds were plodding north toward Barcelona, their few possessions, mattresses, blankets, (...) on their backs, in the wheelbarrows or on their burros' backs. Little children were walking, holding onto their mother's skirts; women carried babies; older children were driving goats and sheep; old men were helping old women along the road; their faces were impassive, dark with the dust of the roads and fields, lined and worn. Their eyes were bright but there was no expression in their eyes. Looking at them, you knew what they were thinking: 'Franco is coming, Franco is coming.'\" \n\nThe Spanish Civil War ended only 13 years ago with the final general offensive of March, 1939.

####Events
twrspain.1.t:0 "The Casablanca Conference"
twrspain.1.d:0 "Delegates from Morocco, Spain and Italy have arrived this morning in the beautiful city of Casablanca to discuss the political situation between Spain and the Kingdom of Morocco, as the Spanish government had recently pressed the issue of integrating Morocco completely into the Spanish North African Territory. The Moroccan puppet government, while still under severe Vichy and German influence, has been rather staunch in its opposition to this plan and the situation has quickly turned tense with Moroccan parties, which had been previously banned, returning as guerillas against Spanish forces in Casablanca. Spanish officials had thus proposed a meeting in Casablanca to discuss the proposal with the Moroccan authorities, with the Italian delegates as mediator."
twrspain.1.a:0 "Let's see how this pans out"
twrspain.2.t:0 "The Casablana Conference"
twrspain.2.d:0 "With the Moroccan delegations ariving to Casablanca this morning, the conference has begun. The recent issue of Moroccan integration into the Spanish colonial territory has been pressed by the Spanish authorities since December last year. King Mohammed the 5th has been opposed to this policy, regarding it as an unfair treatment of the Moroccan people. During this tense period between the kingdom of Morocco and the Spanish state, anti-Spanish parties have popped up once more and started a guerilla war against the Spanish in the Atlas territory. Their struggle has inspired many Moroccan workers and the king has become seriously anxious of the prospect of liberal revolution in Morocco if he bows to the wims of Spain."
twrspain.2.a:0 "Integration is something we can all aspire to"
twrspain.2.b:0 "Morocco will not become the next Ethiopia"
twrspain.3.t:0 "The Casablanca Conference - Morocco Agrees"
twrspain.3.d:0 "In a display of loyalty and knowing their superiours, the Moroccan delegates have caved in to the demands of the Spanish delegates, allowing Spain to fully absorb the Moroccan aparatus into the colonial territory administration and formally ending years of Moroccan monarchy and sovereign rule. While they have accepted, we should not expect an end to the current guerilla combat with the anti-Spanish parties, as they clearly do not listen to any form of government."
twrspain.3.a:0 "Ah, victory..."
twrspain.4.t:0 "The Casablanca Conference - Morocco Refuses"
twrspain.4.d:0 "Tragic news from Casbalanca, Franco: The Moroccan subjects have refused to acknowledge Spain as their superiour, still rejecting our policy of integrating Morocco into the Spanish Empire, and their delegates have made this rather clear to our Spanish delegates. After an awkward ten seconds of silence, our delegates bombarded the Moroccans with insults, ranging from slightly offensive to clearly racist ones, and stormed out of the room, answering the Spanish press and painting a rather negative picture of Morocco. While this happened, the Italian delegate could not be bothered to intervere."
twrspain.4.a:0 "Why did we even invite a mediator?"
twrspain.5.t:0 "Moroccan Police refuses to give Spain anti-Spanish fighters"
twrspain.5.d:0 "The recent display of disrespect shown by our delegates in Morocco has flared up anti-Spanish sentiment in Morocco. This evening, Moroccan officers met with Spanish authorities regarding the transfer of Moroccan Communist rebels to the Spanish authorities. This meeting quickly turned into a brawl, when the Moroccan officers refused to transfer the criminals, saying that they should be judged by Moroccan law and not Spanish law. This blatant disrespect for Spain was answered by the knuckles of the Spanish men, leaving the officers bruised in their office and causing a national scandal the next day."
twrspain.5.a:0 "We'll teach them respect!"
twrspain.6.t:0 "Moroccan Student Riot"
twrspain.6.d:0 "The recent abuse scandal spread through the Moroccan cities like a wildfire and almost every Moroccan man, woman and child has heard of this case of Spanish violence. As answer to the national scandal, students of the Casablanca university took it to the streets today, disrupting the normal activities and causing a mess. Moroccan policemen refused to actively stop the students, leading to the involvement of the Spanish forces there. The Spanish forces quickly resorted to violence against the students, causing the death of several. The protest, while dispersed, quickly turned even more violent, as students now began to avenge the deaths of their comrades. During these riots, 1 Spanish soldier was mortally wounded after being hit by a brick. Morocco is clearly shaken by this riot and we should not expect peace in Casablanca for a while."
twrspain.6.a:0 "Morocco must be pacified!"
twrspain.7.t:0 "Bolshevik Moroccan Students arrested"
twrspain.7.d:0 "A recent raid terrorised Casablanca university, the same place the recent Moroccan riot began, as Spanish authorities suspected that communist activities were getting a grip on the university. During the raid, a small 80 students were arrested, suspected of bolshevik and jewish activities. The students were detained by Spanish forces, even after protest from the Moroccan government."
twrspain.7.a:0 "One can never be too carefull with the reds"
twrspain.8.t:0 "The Rabat Trial"
twrspain.8.d:0 "The recent arrestation of 80 bolshevik and jewish students of the Casablanca university has become a widespread story in both Spain and Morocco. The trials of these 80 men begun 4 days ago and was broadcasted live by both the Moroccan and Spanish state television. The trials have become a point of anti-Spanish tension in Morocco, as many people believe these students to be innocent of any crimes. The trial ended this evening, with 8 being found innocent, 67 found guilty and going to jail and 5 found guilty and going on deathrow, expected to be executed next sunday."
twrspain.8.a:0 "Let's hope it does not become necessary to repeat those trials"
twrspain.9.t:0 "Mohammed V speeches in Rabat"
twrspain.9.d:0 "After the Rabat Trial 6 days ago, Mohammed the 5th, king of Morocco, has come to the big city of Rabat to comfort the families of the students that were executed. In a now infamous speech, Mohammed denounced the practices of the Spanish government in Morocco, calling it nazi-like and authoritarian. His speech went on for 2 hours and slowly turned into generally anti-Spanish rethoric, as the king raged on about the Spanish authorities, even talking about the secrets discussed in Casablance in January. The shock of the public was, at first, paralyzing, but swiftly turned into anti-Spanish rage. His speech ended  with a last warning, threatening to declare a small jihad against the Spanish crown and its caudillo if Spain would not retreat from the Moroccan territory."
twrspain.9.a:0 "Brave, but foolish, my friend"
twrspain.10.t:0 "The Moroccan Ultimatum"
twrspain.10.d:0 "Madrid is in shock, as a small letter from Casablanca has confirmed the worst fear of caudillo Francisco Franco. The letter demands the Spanish armed forces to retreat from Morocco in 48 hours. The letter threatens a complete jihad against Spain if the demands are not completed and is signed by Mohammed the 5th of Morocco. This disrespect for Spanish authority has enraged the cortes and many hardlining falangist members have become proponents of a military campaign that sweeps through Morocco. However, small elements of the military have sympathised with the Moroccan cause and seem to support the ultimatum."
twrspain.10.a:0 "Morocco needs to learn who's the leader of North Africa"
twrspain.10.b:0 "Follow their demands, Morocco is not worth a fight"
twrspain.11.t:0 "Spain does not listen"
twrspain.11.d:0 "Our ultimatum has been met with nothing but silence from Madrid and has thus forced our hand. The Spanish, unwilling to negotiate as tyrants in their castle, have not followed our demands and the colonial garrison stays in Morocco. The Sultan has already ordered the mobilization of the Moroccan troops, awaiting the official decleration of war drafted by a family member."
twrspain.11.a:0 "Morocco will fight forever!"
twrspain.12.t:0 "The Moroccan Defeat"
twrspain.12.d:0 "After a long and demoralizing campaing through Morocco, the Spanish forces have finally given up. The Moroccan army and rebels were able to repel attack after attack and even captured Ifni and the Rif territory from the Spanish. Voices inside the government have thus been openly denouncing the pointless war and Franco is forced to recognize Moroccan independence."
twrspain.12.a:0 "A real disaster..."
twrspain.13.t:0 "Victory in Africa"
twrspain.13.d:0 "Finally, Spanish boots march throughout the city of Casablanca cementing the authority of Francisco Franco in the region. With the crushing defeat of the Moroccan army, Sultan Mohammed the fifth has been begrudingly forced to accept Spanish demands, ending Moroccan independence from Spain completely and accepting a new Spanish governor in charge of Morocco. The treaty, signed in Ifni, will complete the integration project set up by Franco since the 1940s."
twrspain.13.a:0 "Victory is for the Spanish!"
twrspain.14.t:0 "Napalm Run in Morocco"
twrspain.14.d:0 "With the war in Morocco almost reaching its third month, the military has become impatient and irrational in its ways of fighting. Cries for the war to finally end have begun to grow in Spain itself, even if its still concluded to the intellectual corners of society. However, due to their pressure alone, the Spanish airforce has finally outsourced the fight to napalm. The chemical called napalm is known to be highly flamable and has seen use in several former conflicts, but the news of use of the chemical on Moroccan villages has already spread across Spain with a thunderous shock for most. How can we, the civilizing force of christianity, use such a rotten and devilish substance? Many have started to question the army, but have yet to see the faults in Franco's government."
twrspain.14.a:0 "Turn down the napalm for a month..."
twrspain.15.t:0 "Student Draft-Dodging"
twrspain.15.d:0 "Gonzalez, student at the university of Madrid, ran through the countryside. As a young and fit male, he was forced by the government to fight in the conflict in Africa. However, wishing to once be a great musician, Gonzalez actively dodged the draft, something punishable by jail-time. His escape from the university and the grip of the secret police would be a short victory, as the government would continue to be on his tail. Today, this barn will be his last resort to dodge the draft. His last hope. \n\nWith the continueing war down South, Spanish citizens, mostly studying at university, have began to avoid their mobilization en-masse. These cowards are currently either in jail or hunted by the special secret police, but the growing popularity of draft-dodging has forced to government to expand the police force and even open up a special department against draft-dodging."
twrspain.15.a:0 "Cowards!"
twrspain.16.t:0 "Homage to Ceuta"
twrspain.16.d:0 "Cueta, city of seven hills and seven sons, has lately been a battleground, but not just between Moroccans and Spanishmen, but also between politicians. The brewing city of heat and Spanish civilization has seen controversy the likes of it have never stepped foot on this part of Spain. Politicians from around the region have begun singing the same song, complaining about the war, always in a negative tone. Their complaints, ranging from the lenght of the war to the military control of the war, has been annoyingly distrusted by Franco's capital of Madrid. Thus, only a common soldier like me can tell the people about Cueta... \n\nThe first passage of Italian Stefano Della Chiaie's book 'Homage to Ceuta' has become known worlwide among Moroccan war supporters. The recent publishment of the book shows the war in a positive light and perspective from the fascist writer of the book, gloryifing the violence as a showcase of what a civilizing mission should include."
twrspain.16.a:0 "If it helps the war effort, good enough..."
MOR_DEAD:0 "§RThis will lead to annexation§!"
twrspain.17.t:0 "Student Movement established"
twrspain.17.d:0 "Martin Moruga is a straight-A student of the university of Barcelona. He's a social person with a big group of friends, yet he keeps a secret from them, in fear of the government finding out: he's part of the illegal student movement. The Spanish student movement has its roots in German Europe, most notably in Vichy France, where the new young generation of university students have started to rebel against the authoritarian nature of statehood in Europe. Their anti-authoritarian ideology has been the main basis for Franco and his government to criminalize the student movement in Spain prior to his death. However, as is the nature of underground societies and organisations, the student movement has been rather popular among the regions of Spain. The hotbed of the current movement is Barcelona, filled to the brim with angered Catalan nationalists, republicans and bolsheviks, plotting the demise of Francoist Spain. While the secret service of Spain is currently doing a rather clean job of surpressing it, we cannot surpress the movement forever."
twrspain.17.a:0 "The nature of young-adults is troublesome..."
twrspain.18.t:0 "Barcelona citizen shot and killed"
twrspain.18.d:0 "Trouble in Barcelona! \n\nReports from the police department of Catalonia and the state-dependent media of the region has confirmed that a Barcelona student known as Juan Costa has been killed in a police incident. After bursting through the door of a local student club, which was suspected to house anti-Spanish activists, Barcelona policemen shot the 19 year old Juan, suspecting him to flee the scene. The shot instantly killed him, according to later medical reports, hitting a vital piece of the heart. The death of the young student has been mourned across Spain by Francoists and anti-Francoists alike and has sparked public debate on the roll of the regional police departments. The fact that the kid was a Catalan activist has also destabilized the region, with many students currently rioting in the city against the government."
twrspain.18.a:0 "Maldita Sea!"
twrspain.19.t:0 "Madrid Protest"
twrspain.19.d:0 "With the recent death of Juan, students in Madrid have taken it to the streets without government approval, protesting against police violence. Their march has attracted not only students, but known political activists with ties with the anarchist and socialist underground, such as the FELN. The military police has been dispatched across the entirety of Madrid and constantly follows the protest. The internal ministry has every alarm bell ringing and are putting pressure on Blanco, demanding him to take action against the protest before it gets out of hand."
twrspain.19.a:0 "Authorize the use of force to end it"
twrspain.19.b:0 "We don't want civil war, dammit!" 
twrspain.20.t:0 "Protest turns into riot"
twrspain.20.d:0 "With the authorization of force by Blanco, the military police quickly went to work to divide the protest into smaller groups. However, after an hour of battle and beatings, the protest did not want to split apart. Thus, the use of tear gas was eventually authorized by the ministry. While the gas helped for a moment, the protests clearly did not react well with this decision and quickly turned violent. With the outbreak of riots in Madrid, the government swiftly fortified parliament, hoping that the riot would end later. The fortification of parliament has been 10 hours ago now, and the riots have yet to die down."
twrspain.20.a:0 "A grave error on our part..."
twrspain.21.t:0 "State of National Emergency Declared"
twrspain.21.d:0 "With the Madrid riots growing worse and worse every day, the Spanish government has declared a state of national emergency, suspending the rights of the Spanish citizen and granting the armed forces the right to govern Spain through these difficult times. Blanco's decision to declare the state has been one of controversy among the party members and his position as Caudillo might be on the line for it. General Emilio Esteban-Infantes, the current chief of staff of the army, has been the most vocal proponent of declaring a state of emergency and is currently tasked with ending the riots in Madrid."
twrspain.21.a:0 "Can this be any worse?"
twrspain.22.t:0 "Death of Francisco Franco"
twrspain.22.d:0 "Francisco Franco, Caudillo of Spain and its overseas territories, has been killed at the hands of a lone gunman. \n\nIt happened rather quickly, even for an assassination: During one of his many speeches after the Moroccan war, trying to increase moral among the Spanish people, Franco's head was hit by a bullet going around 830 m/s, splattering his brains on the balcony of El Pardo, dying instantly. His death quickly spread panic, but the military police was eventually able to detain the suspect. The French man of average height was seen carrying around a SVT-40, a Soviet semi-automatic rifle produced during Operation Barbarossa and still used by underground partisans sponsored by the now ailing Soviet Union. His trial will be on a later date. For the moment, Luis Carrero Blanco has been appointed Caudillo of Spain by Franco's will and the Cortes."
twrspain.22.a:0 "With the death of Franco comes the death of the party..."
twrspain.23.t:0 "End of an Era"
twrspain.23.d:0 "It has now been almost a month since the declaration of national emergency. The riot, while it has ended, has turned Madrid into an entity seperate from the national government. This territory is now lawless, as the military police is unable to properly reinforce any kind of law. Harassment towards the police has made the region around the parliament a no-go zone for the police corps. Blanco, heavily frustated and, according to some close friends, on the brink of crying, has finally given up. A formal meeting with the supposed student movement leadership will end the fate of a man who did not want to be a Caudillo of a broken Spain, and with him the Francoist regime as a whole. We will see if this truely will be a new dawn for Spanish democracy..."
twrspain.23.a:0 "Out with the old..."
twrspain.24.t:0 "Return of the Exiled Government"
twrspain.24.d:0 "With the end of the Spanish civil war, an exodus of Republican sympathisers fled from Spain to South and Central America. A group of these survivors, under the leadership of the former Republican government, decided to form a government in exile, contesting the legitimacy of the Spanish state. While they've been next to useless against Franco's regime since the 1940s, their presence still cements republicanism in Spain as a solid ideology. Thus, the Spanish parliament has decided to meet with the exiles in Madrid and welcome them back to Spain and its political landscape, adopting their flag in the process to represent a true Third Republic."
twrspain.24.a:0 "Allies in idealism!"
twrspain.25.t:0 "Spanish Refugees flee Morocco"
twrspain.25.d:0 "The defeat of Spain in the Moroccan conflict has had major social consequences for the Rif region and its inhabitants. With the natives of the Rif angered at Spanish colonists due to increasing Moroccan nationalism and the grudges hold after the Rif War of the 1920s, many Spaniards living across the strait have decided to pack their belongings and leave the former Spanish territory. This massive stream of political refugees has worried Andalusian locals and politicians, regarding the low economic opportunity in the region prior to the refugees and advising that the region cannot sustain thousands of refugees with just government spending."
twrspain.25.a:0 "What a disaster"
twrspain.26.d:0 "During the recent establishment of the third republic, we were expecting opposition to the liberal reforms. This opposition has manifested itself as the Búnker, a large branch of the military with political loyalty to the former Francoist regime. Headed by Blas Piñar and General Fernando de Santiago, this group of hardline falangists has made reform rather difficult and makes it impossible to liberalize the army, as the liberal faction of the armed forces is small compared to the Búnker."
twrspain.26.a:0 "A big problem..."
twrspain.26.t:0 "The Búnker"
twrspain.27.t:0 "The Búnker Coup"
twrspain.27.d:0 "Shocked surprise riples through Spain, as the parliamentary democracy established after the Madrid Riot has seemingly been for nothing: The hardline fascist faction of the military, known on government papers as 'The Búnker', has dismissed the parliament in a coup d'etat, establishing a military junta. Many elements and members of the liberal and socialist parties have already fled the city of Madrid, as its in the iron grasp of Piñar and de Santiago. The PCE has, once again, gone underground, preparing for armed revolution and abandoning their moderate stance in an instance. The armed forces have yet to properly secure Madrid."
twrspain.27.a:0 "Is this the end of Spanish democracy?"
twrspain.28.t:0 "A Spectre Haunts Madrid"
twrspain.28.d:0 "The streets of Madrid appear empty today. The lively city hasn't been hit by a pandemic, nor has a national emergency been announced. Instead, the capital of the Spanish Republic experiences something completely else, a force unknown to nature: ideological tension. While violence has shortly been surpressed with the victory of the NLC, the council has also started to isolate itself from the public eye, perhaps for preperations. The current social climate has thus become tense: Socialists and former Falangists share a hatred for eachother and there seems little to stop them going at it, with only the haunting ghost of communist pressure keeping the streets of Madrid empty. \n\nLooking through the window, you see only one policeman walking down the street."
twrspain.28.a:0 "..."
twrspain.29.t:0 "A Visit in Blue"
twrspain.29.d:0 "A gentle knock on the door echoes through the halls of a small house in Zaragoza. After opening the door, the man of the house sees who knocked on his oak wooden entrance: the police. 'May we come in?', the tall one asks. Reluctantly, the man lets the 2 men in. 'Could we possibly enjoy a cup of tea while we're here? we only want to ask some questions, nothing more', the shorter policeman asks. The man nods. \n\nAfter a long tea break, the 2 policemen finally leave the house. 'We're looking forward to meeting you again, señor!', they say and leave the house. Only a climate of tension brought by the 2 men stays, while the man, my father, breaks down crying. I can only wonder what they asked him."
twrspain.29.a:0 "..."
twrspain.30.t:0 "My Grandpa was a Francoist"
twrspain.30.d:0 "Due to the recent government change, Erica was forced to change secondary school this week. Her old, catholic school was closed down after a government inspection deeming it to clerical and fascist-friendly. Thus, she has been moved to a big city school, far away from her rural home. \n\n'So, Erica, tell something about yourself' the new teacher softly demanded. Without really thinking about it, Erica began about her family: 'Well, my family lives outside Valencia, owning a big plot of land for the cattle. The plot of land was given several years ago for grandpa's deeds during 1937.' \n\nAfter saying that, Erica notices that the teacher tenses up. The whole class quietly looks at her. 20 seconds passes till rumours start to be exchanged across the floor. 'Perhaps her grandpa worked with Franco', 'He could have been a traitor to the republic', 'Most likely helped the carlist party in Valencia!' The chaos was finally ended by the teacher, now firmly grasping Erica's shoulder before telling her that, 'She shouldn't start about her family again if she actually cares about them.'"
twrspain.30.a:0 "..."
twrspain.31.t:0 "The First Congress"
twrspain.31.d:0 "Today, Spain experienced the first congress of the Comintern-loyal Socialist Party. The congress, organized by Sabaté and his loyal followers, opened with a speech from the great leader himself, declaring an official end to the period of terror Spain has known since the liberation council's appearance. His speech applauded the student movement's actions and highlighted the recent events surrounding the death of Enrique Galván, former moderate revolutionary and opposition leader against Sabaté's military wing, as a lucky break for the party, denouncing his moderate stance as a 'threat to Spanish marxism as we know it'. His speech was brief, yet it has clearly cemented the new feeling Spain is now associated with: A feeling not unlike the Soviet Union under the great Joseph Stalin. The final hours of the congress were spend mostly on reorganizing the new bureaucracy of Spain, ending with the decision to allow the post of First Chairman, held by Sabaté, more power on the judicial system."
twrspain.31.a:0 "Para el Partido, Todo!"
twrspain.32.t:0 "Establishment of the SJPS"
twrspain.32.d:0 "with the end of the Purga Revolucionaria, Sabaté and his loyal followers have finally cleaned Spain from any kind of opposition to his regime. The Red Brigades of Sabaté parade through the major cities of Spain, a clear sign of things to come for the poor people of Spain. With this, Sabaté finally felt the need to formalize the former student movement into more of a party. Thus, he has proposed the formation of the Young Blood Socialist Party (Spanish: Sangre Joven Partido Socialista). The ranks of the party are currently mostly filled with young, fanatical veterans of the Red Wind Period, ready to change Spain to their perfect image for their great leader. While this may seem rather great for Sabaté, the formation of the party has also clearly shown many old members of the movement the true face of Sabaté, comparing him to the former Joseph Stalin in his approaches. Thus, a large chunk of the former student and union base has been lost to the more anarchist and liberal parties still present in Spain."
twrspain.32.a:0 "Great!"
twrspain.33.t:0 "The Changing Course Speech"
twrspain.33.d:0 "The recent failure of the Moroccan War haunts Spain. People still crave an answer and a response from the government. They need a scapegoat. \n\nToday, Francisco Franco acompanied with Luis Carrero Blanco and Raimundo Fernández-Cuesta, adressed the concerned public in a speech from Madrid. Franco, who has clearly lost a lot of energy during this past couple of weeks, explained the current situation of the Spanish retreat from Morocco, finally acknowledging his defeat in the conflict. However, cunning as Franco is, he has not acknowledged it as his failure, but that of his high command and a lack of coordination. After this twist, Franco continued to explain his plans for the future of Spain without its crown colony: a complete political reformation of the bureaucracy and government, as to turn it into a less divided and more efficient machine.

However, despite all of this, Francisco Franco has finally dismissed his entire high command today, citing their failure in the Moroccan campaign as unacceptable. Anger now stirs these same officers. The fear is not completely gone, but anger has taken its place for the most part. Franco's incompetence during the war had cost us Morocco, yet the high command has been blamed for his mistake. As the last of the old officers leave the room, plans have already been set in motion, though its unclear if its their plans or Franco's."

A major figure of the Catalan campaign of the Civil War, Arrondo had been nothing more than a figurehead of the old military officer corps. While never an official member of any anti-Francoist resistance inside or outside the government, many officials of the FET y de la JONS worried that he would be a popular rallying point for the old guard. That problem, however, has now dissapeared with his death. The cause of death has already been confirmed: suicide using a FN model 1910 produced in Herstal, Germany."

The falangist branch of the national movement, led by Manuel Hedilla, made it clear to Franco and his court that the official abandonment of the national syndicalist economic theory by the ministry of the treasury would lead to unfortunate consequences, clearly not refering to any financial consequences brought to us by abandoning falangist thought. Franco, clearly not flattered by this remark and inspired by his old ministers, kept pushing for the final reform of abandoning the theory and officially ended falangist theorem in the ministry this morning. The news spread quickly across Madrid and, within hours, the Falangist youth, womens and paramilitary branches had gathered around the palace. Armed to the teeth, these men and women saw to harm Franco and his followers and, thus, the military was called upon for backup. Intimidated by this display of power, the falangist rebels broke into smaller groups and terrorized the streets of Madrid for 6 hours, killing 27 Spaniards (of which 24 Jewish) and 16 foreigners. The rebellion ended with the arrest of Hedilla in A Coruña, forcing the rest of the falangist hierarchy to give up. While the rebellion has ended, falangists are still sabotaging our government in small cliques and clusters of militias."

The followers of Hedilla have clearly taken an anti-government stance on the issue, fighting for the inclusion of the national-syndicalist rethoric inherint to the falangist movement. On the other hand, the more traditionalist members of the Falange have chosen Franco's side, rejecting Hedilla's teachings as bolshevik and seeing him as a threat to the national security. With this issue, the party has split apart into the conservative Falange National Movement and the National Syndicalist Attack Junta led by Hedilla. The nueva JONS, as Hedilla's party is known, has already been criminalized by the national movement, while the Falange has been readopted into Franco's party."

The troops, 47,000 men strong, were awarded by Hitler in the early 1940s with a medal of their own, yet they have seen no compensation from the Spanish government for their fight against Bolshevism. Only half of the 47,000 men survived the conflict and now live in Spain, shellshocked by the brutality of the Eastern Front compared to any other front seen at that point. The brutality of both the barbarians of the German SS, as well as the fanatic suicidal tendencies of the Soviet troops has scarred many of the former Blue Division and they now live in absolute poverty, unable to properly function in our society. \n\nThe Falangist elements of the Movement have made recently reignited the debate on the issue of compensating these 'heroes of Spain' financially. Their proposal is often met with harsh criticism from all sides, regarding the fact that many men were volunteers and that they didn't even serve Spain in any conflict. Some have accused the Falangist branch of trying to expand their own power with this proposal, but Hedilla is verhemently denied such a conspiracy."

While the civil war did not hit San Sebastián particularly hard, due to it immediately falling into the hands of Franco's supporters, it lost its cultural glamor and would not regain after the conflict of the 30s. \n\nHowever, perhaps due to this lack of glamor and culture, several merchants decided to host a festival this year in San Sebastián, known as the San Sebastián Film Festival. The festival will showcase several foreign films to the Spanish public of San Sebastián, with the goal to energize the city and its culture once more. Due to the official support of the government and the possibility of being internationally recognized by the IFAMPP has led to little to no censorship regarding the films, though only Spanish movies are able to win awards during the festival. \n\nGreat Movies such as Don Camilo, House of Wax, The war of God and Mission in Buenos Aires will be shown during the week and several personalities from across the globe will attend the festival, such as Yoshiko Yamaguchi, Tilda Thamar and Jacqueline Naves. The great success and influence of the festival has already peaked the interest of the government and next years festival will thus be completely organized by the government, with the merchants being an integral part of the new organization committee."

His opinion is swiftly shared by the married couple and their son and they soon pack their stuff, with the intention of returning to their warm homes in Spain. Before they have finished packing their stuff, a bullet hits the ground next to them and the group, in the ensuing panic, are killed in the raging battle between the opposing armies.

This division, among other things, has been the reason for the rise of Basque nationalism and the ETA, a movement with its roots in the old student movement.

While the entire FELN party can only praise their efforts against fascism and the sacrifices they had to make, del Vayo fears the growing power of the universities inside Spain, accusing it of expanding urban culture and influence to the poor people of the countryside, who, in his eyes, are the real heroes of socialism due to their unwavering resistance against Franco since the end of 1939 in unorganized militias. Galván, on the other hand, has accused del Vayo of picking sides when there isn't a conflict, trying to play the students against the rural population in an effort to expand his own grip on Spanish society."

Their effort was without a doubt a true inspiration for the later students and their coup against the old traditional order of Franco and Blanco. However, with the return of democracy, anarchists have become a danger to stability, according to del Vayo and his supporters. While del Vayo is in favour of demilitarizing the anarchists in Spain, especially in the autonomous community of Catalonia, Galván has criticized del Vayo for his anti-libertarian stance, accusing him of authoritarian measures and comparing him to the old Soviet dictator, Joseph Stalin, and his great purge."

While the Internationale is currently in a rough shape after the failure of the Soviet Union to keep the Germans from Moscow, marxism continues to spread across the globe, with or without foreign support. Del Vayo's faction has thus adopted a policy of 'Socialism, only in Spain', in which Spain has to isolate itself from the European continent and grow its socialist government through interior decisions. Galván has, once again, seen the similarities between del Vayo's agenda and the old Soviet policy of 'Socialism in One Country' and has loudly criticized del Vayo for his betrayal to the international proletariat, using Marx's Das Kapital as proof."

IB_council_of_economic_interests_coordination_desc:0 "This proposal, proposed by Juan Vigón and Francisco de Llano, details the establishment of an Iberian organ divided between 5 Portuguese and 5 Spanish officers and economists to advice both governments on their military spending. This idea, inspired by the former Little Entente and its economic interest coordination, would allow for more economic and military integration of the 2 nations and open up the way for later military reforms."

In Spain, the military police has become known for effectively surpressing riots and Catalan independence attempts, leaving them as some of the best trained in Europe. In Portugal, the military police has mostly seen action in its capital and the colonies overseas, keeping the peace in both Angola and Mozambique and acting against the anti-imperialist criminals working against the Estado Novo government."
