#Description
Chen_Cheng_DESC:0 "Graduating from Baoding Military Academy in 1922, Chen Cheng entered Whampoa Military Academy two years later, meeting Chiang Kai-shek for the first time, then Commandant of the Academy. Later on, Chen joined National Revolutionary Army, which he climbed up the rank structure with flying colours. His successes allowed him to be promoted time and time again, eventually becoming the commander of the 18th Army.\n\nAfter the end of the Second Chinese Civil War, Chen Cheng's close ties with Chiang Kai-shek and his influence within the military landed Chen a favourable position as the Overseer of the Dongbei Authority, a department overseeing the reconstruction and development of former Manchuria.\n\nIn the Northeast, Chen Cheng solidified his power and strengthened his 'Tu Mu' Clique, later cementing his position as the Generalissimo's successor."
Li_Zongren_DESC:0 "리쭝런은 한 마을의 소년에서 차이어 아래에서 군 복무를 하고 구이린 군관학교를 졸업하여 1916년에는 광시 군벌의 루룽팅의 아래에서 소대장이 되었습니다.\n\n리중런이 출세하게된 계기에는 광시군번 구계계와 국민당의 부상이 얽혀 있으며, 이후 광시의 군벌로 활동하며 이 지역을 다스리게 됩니다. 어느 순간, 그는 중앙 정부와 갈등을 벌이며 장제스의 통치에 반대를 선언했지만 항복하게 되었습니다. 그리고 중일전쟁이 벌어지자, 현대식 교리와 강력한 군사력으로 무장했던 리쭝런은 정부 내부에서 고위직을 역임하게 되었고, 부총통이 되었으며, 나중에는 총통과 갈등을 겪기도 했습니다."
Chen_Lifu_DESC:0 "Chen Lifu spent most of his early life as a typical intellectual with a promising future in fields of engineering, having no interest in politics. However, his brother Chen Guofu fully devoted himself in the business of politics, and eventually used his close ties with Chiang to gain the position of Confidential Secretary for Chen Lifu, pushing Chen Lifu into the inner circle at a relatively young age.\n\nChen Guofu and Chen Lifu were considered the masters of the Central Club, known by others as the CC Clique, and while Chen Guofu had the most amount of political capital and led the CC Clique into prominent status, his worsening illness and eventual death in 1951 elevated Chen Lifu's status. While Chen Lifu has retained his lack of interest in over-the-top politicking, he has sworn to pick up the legacy of his older brother, and has fully committed himself to the role of a politician."
He_Yingqin_DESC:0 "A native of Guizhou, He Yingqin is the model revolutionary military leader that witnessed China's transformation through the eras. He became acquainted with his fellow student Chiang Kai-shek when studying in Japan, and studied most of his military skills from Imperial Japan.\n\nHolding a position in the officer rank since 1916, He Yingqin was appointed the General Instructor of Whampoa Military Academy, slowly climbing his way to a high position within the National Revolutionary Army. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, He Yingqin was appointed the Chief of Staff and worked closely with the Generalissimo on developing military strategies, reaching the peak of his career and granting him a great amount of power to become one of the leaders in the Huangpu Clique.\n\nAfter the war and the following resuming of the Civil War, He Yingqin maintained his high status within the government and the military, later on becoming the leader of China after years and years of anticipation."
Xiong_Shihui_DESC:0 "Xiong Shihui graduated from Baoding Military Academy in 1915 and later finished his military education in Japan by 1924.\n\nXiong Shihui was appointed by Chiang Kai-shek as the Chief of Jiangxi in 1931, and from that point onward he crawled his way into the core of the political system. During this time, Xiong Shihui has slowly became a prominent member of the Political Science Clique, serving in the Northeast after the Second Sino-Japanese War before being replaced by Chen Cheng's Dongbei Authority.\n\nWith Zhang Qun, Xiong Shihui has managed to expand the Political Science Clique, and later using his character and influence to become the leader, and eventually - the President of the Republic of China."
Zhang_Qun_DESC:0 "Zhang Qun studied in the Baoding Military Academy, but soon studied military in Japan. There, he became the schoolmate of Chiang Kai-shek, later on, taking part in many of the internal conflicts that occured in China.\n\nOther than military, Zhang Qun also took part in politics, becoming the Mayor of Shanghai by 1930, Chief of Hubei by 1932 and eventually, the Security Commander of Sichuan. After the Second Sino-Japanese War, Zhang Qun took part in various multinational diplomatic conferences under the orders of Chiang, at the same time, he slowly solidified the Political Science Clique's position within the Central Government, using his experience in politics to ensure the prosperity of his faction and himself, ultimately taking the position of Chiang Kai-shek's successor."

LU_HAN_DESC:0 "§YLu Han§!\n\n§gA military man, Lu Han served under Long Yun in the Yunnan Army. The two men had a strong bond with their history of overthrowing the Old Yunnan Clique together and other military actions during the Second Sino-Japanese War. However, during the renewed Chinese Civil War, Long Yun was heavily suspected due to his alleged communist ties. The Central Government placed significant pressure on Yunnan, forcing Long Yun to resign.\n\nSince Long Yun's \"willing resignation\", Lu Han has stepped in and replaced Yun as the Governor of Yunnan. Lu Han seeks to continue Long's policy of development and socio-economic stability in Yunnan, with occasional military cooperation with the Central Government.§!"
YUN_DESC:0 "§YYunnan Faction§!\n\n§gThe Yunnan Army, having existed since the Qing Dynasty, is a regional power that has extended its influence far beyond the confines of Yunnan Province. During the early 20th Century, Yunnan was famously influenced by the French presence in Indochina, developing a unique, modern military style as a result. With qualities such as high quality equipment, courageous troops and a history of fearless devotion to the Republic, Yunnan soldiers have gained good reputations in the minds of fellow Chinese soldiers and their enemies.§!"
GXC_DESC:0 "§YGuangxi Faction§!\n\n§gHistorically disadvantaged due to its location, the rough terrain of the region shaped Guangxi's troops into unbelievably tough fighters. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Guangxi soldiers demonstrated their willingness to sacrifice themselves for victory in battle. Thanks to Guangxi's great involvement during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the province's conditions have been improved, which has resulted in an increased quality of equipment for the local military.§!"
MAN_DESC:0 "§YDongbei Faction§!\n\n§gThe current Dongbei Faction has no relation to the old Fengtian Clique. The Dongbei Faction (Tu Mu), formerly known as the 11th Corp-18th Army is an elite military formation under Chen Cheng. This formation was regarded the best equipped in all of China (thanks to Chen Cheng's status), serving as elite formation during the Second Sino-Japanese War. These advantages have continued to this day, using confiscated Manchukuo and Japanese military equipment, Dongbei is one of the first regions in China that have experimented with military mechanization.§!"
SHX_DESC:0 "§Y산시 군벌§!\n\n§g역사적으로 산시는 적대 세력들에게 둘러싸여 있었습니다. 하지만 이러한 혼란에도 불구하고, 산시는 풍부한 천연자원으로 꾸준히 발전하며 안정을 유지하고 있습니다. 산시는 중국 최고의 소화기 생산지중 하나로 잘 알려져 있으며, 중국 군부에 일정한 품질의 물자를 공급하고 있습니다.§!"
XIBEI_DESX:0 "§YXibei Faction§!\n\n§gFeared by its foes, the Xibei Ma Army is famous for its great calvary formations. These horse warriors from Northwest China struck fear in both the Chinese Communists and the invading Japanese, with these troops being a significant factor in the Communists' defeat in the North. However, these forces are exceptionally brutal in combat, a trait commonly seen among the ranks due to their nomadic roots.§!"
LI_ZONGREN_WARLORD_DESC:0 "§YLi Zongren§!\n\n§gLi Zongren is an esteemed figure. From his acts of overthrowing the Old Guangxi Clique to serving under the Republic, Li Zongren found the most glory during his service in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Li's masterful leadership secured China some much needed victories during a time of dire national morale, elevating his status beyond that of a Guangxi Hero, into a National Hero.\n\nWith this newfound respect and resources after the war, Li Zongren is once again handling Guangxi. However, his quarrels with the Central Government developed in the Central Plains War has lingered on, leading to a gradual increase in involvement on the Central Government's politics. Perhaps Li Zongren's goals have expanded beyond the small, barren region of Guangxi, and has now take shape as a vision for China as a whole.§!"
CHEN_CHENG_WARLORD_DESC:0 "§YChen Cheng§!\n\n§gChen Cheng is a skillful figure, both as a military man and a trusted bureaucrat. With close ties to Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng gained a favourable position as "Head of the Dongbei Authority" after the end of the Chinese Civil War, transforming his elite military formation into a new, strong regional power in Chinese politics.\n\nDespite his appointment in Dongbei, Chen never gave up on his ambitions in the Central Government, maintaining his allies and connections in Nanjing, while simultaneously developing his regional might to repeatedly increase his influence on national politics. As Chiang's protégé, Chen's plans might be far grander than maintaining his influence as the leader of Dongbei - plans that might seek to alter China drastically if conditions would present such an opportunity.§!"
YAN_XISHAN_DESC:0 "§Y옌시산§!\n\n§g옌시산은 당대의 다른 군벌들과는 다르게 권력과 재물로 기뻐하는 사람이 아니었습니다. 옌시산이 진정으로 원하는 것은 기반시설, 농업 개선, 양질의 교육등 동포들의 생계를 향상시키는 것이었습니다.\n\n그의 계획은 안정과 번영을 위해서 사상을 중심으로 진행되지만, 옌시산은 특정한 이념을 가지고 있지는 않습니다. 그리고 그는 그의 성 안에 있는 동포들의 삶의 질을 향상시키기 위하여 진보적인 계획을 기꺼이 실행하려고 합니다. 그러나 이것은 옌시산이 그의 지방과 그의 동포들만을 좋아할뿐, 더 넓은 정치 세계를 선호하지 않는다는 것을 의미합니다.§!"
MA_HONGKUI_DESC:0 "§YMa Hongkui§!\n\n§gSon of the famous general Ma Fuxiang, Ma Hongkui is a leading figure in the Ma Faction, with his position as Governor of Ningxia granting him great privileges. Often, Ma Hongkui is referred by many as "the King of Ningxia", with his almost monarchical power and lavish lifestyle silently tolerated by the Central Government - perhaps a favour given by the Central Government thanks to Ma Hongkui's harsh stance on slaughtering Chinese Communists.\n\nAlong with Ma Bufang and Ma Hongbin, Ma Hongkui is a core member of the Ma Clique.§!"
MA_HONGBIN_DESC:0 "§YMa Hongbin§!\n\n§gSon of Ma Fulu and a cousin of Ma Hongkui, Ma Hongbin is a successful general, managing to defeat both Japanese and Communist forces while leading the 81th Army. Like other prominent members of the Ma Faction, Ma Hongbin also enjoys great influence and power over his governate in Gansu.\n\nAlong with Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang, Ma Hongbin is a core member of the Ma Clique.§!"
MA_BUFANG_DESC:0 "§YMa Bufang§!\n\n§gSon of the famous Ma Qi, Ma Bufang's rise to power was an impressive feat, with cooperation and pacts formed with other neighbouring factions, effectively creating the modern Ma Clique. Ma Bufang is a capable general and a regional leader. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he demonstrated his loyalty to the Republic and his willingness to defend the nation with his multi-cultural army. In many forms, Ma Bufang is the dominant figure compared to his neighbouring Mas, backed up by his powerful figure and strong character.\n\nBeing a core member of the Ma Clique, alongside Ma Hongkui and Ma Hongbin, Ma Bufang is also involved with national politics, with close relations to the Huangpu Clique.§!"
MA_HUSHAN_DESC:0 "§YMa Hushan§!\n\n§gUnlike the other Mas, Ma Hushan's influence in Xinjiang is relatively new. Once a follower of Ma Zhongying, Ma Hushan has a long history of activity in Xinjiang, with him briefly ruling as the leader of "Tunganistan", a fundamentalist, mismanaged state in the southern parts of Xinjiang. However, not long after the establishment of Tunganistan, Ma Hushan soon found himself abandoned by his people, which resulted in his eventual defeat by Xinjiang warlord Sheng Shicai.\n\nDisgraced, Ma Hushan became an irrelevant member of the Ma Clique, unable to redeem himself until the successful invasion of Xinjiang, which Ma Hushan was finally appointed as the Governor of Xinjiang, replacing the former Pro-Soviet Sheng, becoming a new, yet important part of the Ma Clique.§!"

CHI_The_Southern_Border:0 "남방 국경"
CHI_The_Southern_Border_desc:0 "우리가 중국 내부의 공산주의자들은 박살냈지만, 살아남은 공산주의자들은 이웃 국가로 도망갔습니다. 많은 이들이 공산당이 지배하는 베트남으로 도망갔고, 호치민은 이들을 환영했습니다. 우리는 베트남을 반역자들을 도운 적국으로 간주하고, 우리의 남쪽 국경선에 존재하는 국가를 바꿔놓아야 합니다."
CHI_War_Of_Liberation:0 "해방전쟁"
CHI_War_Of_Liberation_desc:0 "우리의 민족주의적인 베트남 동맹국은 우리 국경근처의 베트남 북부에서 일어날 준비가 되어있고, 우리는 공격을 할 준비가 되어있습니다. 우리는 단지 신호를 주고, 베트남의 공산주의자들에게서 해방시키기 위해 군대를 파견하면 됩니다."
CHI_The_Grand_Victory:0 "위대한 승리"
CHI_The_Grand_Victory_desc:0 "이 전쟁은 우리가 예상했던 것보다 힘들었지만, 결국 우리의 군대는 베트남 공산주의자들보다 강력했습니다. 호치민은 쓰러졌고, 베트남은 우리의 동맹국이 지배합니다. 이것은 중국 뿐만 아니라 장제스에게도 위대한 승리입니다. 이제 그의 통치권은 더욱 강화될 것입니다."

CHI_Consolidation_of_Power:0 "권력 집중"
CHI_Consolidation_of_Power_desc:0 "최근 베트남에서의 승리는 장제스의 위신에 많은 도움이 되었습니다. 이 전쟁에서 승리할수 있을지 의심하는 사람들이 있었지만, 이제 그들은 침묵을 지키고 있습니다. 장제스는 이제 당, 국가, 정부에 대한 통치를 더욱 공고히 할수 있고, 마침내 계획을 진행할수 있게 되었습니다."
CHI_Victory_in_the_Struggles:0 "투쟁에서의 승리"
CHI_Victory_in_the_Struggles_desc:0 "국민당 내의 반역자가 장제스를 제거하려고 시도했지만, 다행히도 그들의 공격은 실패했습니다. 장제스의 지위는 베트남에서의 패배로 심각한 손상을 입었지만, 총통은 그럼에도 불구하고 권력을 유지할수 있었습니다. 권력의 기반을 재건하는 것은 그에게 달려있습니다."

CHI_Control_the_Kuomintang_desc:0 "국민당은 오랫동안 약하고 분열되어 있었습니다. 전쟁이 일어나면 국민당은 힘을 합쳐 장제스의 지휘를 받아야 합니다. 당에게 약점이란 있을수 없습니다. 당은 반드시 하나여야 합니다."
CHI_Crush_The_Communist_Elements:0 "공산주의자의 잔재 파괴"
CHI_Crush_The_Communist_Elements_desc:0 "With the Vietnam war distracting our armed forces, hidden communist elements had again begun to rise from the ashes. This is simply an unacceptable threat to the country. We must again sweep the nation to stamp out the communist menace once and for all."
CHI_New_White_Terror:0 "새로운 백색테러"
CHI_New_White_Terror_desc:0 "Violence and brutality is the only way to crush the communists. Every time they have been beaten in the past, they have escaped and risen again. This time, we must hunt them down and destroy them with such terror that they are smashed once and for all and will never rise again. A new 'white terror' will be unleashed across the country."
CHI_The_Chinese_Agenda:0 "중국의 문제들"
CHI_The_Chinese_Agenda_desc:0 "China, as a nation, must rise back to its rightful place on the world stage. The effects of the century of humiliation must at last be undone. China must follow a foreign policy agenda that pushes for its rightful hegemony over Asia to be restored, and Chiang Kai-shek is the man who will push this agenda forwards."
CHI_Anti_Imperialistic_Diplomacy:0 "반제국주의 외교"
CHI_Anti_Imperialistic_Diplomacy_desc:0 "Ever since the beginning of the 'century of humiliation', western imperialists have dominated Asian affairs. Even as the power of the Europeans wanes as a result of the German hegemony, the Americans rise to fill their place, extending their influence across the pacific and supporting puppets in Korea, eastern Russia and South East Asia. This must now be brought to an end. Asia must liberate itself, with China as its protector."
CHI_The_Great_Republic:0 "위대한 민국"
CHI_The_Great_Republic_desc:0 "With Chiang's policies, China is restoring its place, with the prestige of old, but led as a republic rather than an empire. China can now truly call itself a great republic, a modern nation of hundreds of millions and vast territories, the size of an empire but with institutions to fit the modern age."
CHI_Cult_Of_Personality:0 "개인숭배"
CHI_Cult_Of_Personality_desc:0 "The success and greatness of China is, more than anything, due to the strong and capable leadership of the Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. It was him that guided China through difficult times, and the people must come to know and appreciate that. The image and words of Chiang will be printed and spoken across the nation, so all will recognise their great leader."
CHI_Weaken_Key_Opponents:0 "주요 적수 약화"
CHI_Weaken_Key_Opponents_desc:0 "Within the KMT, there are those that have secretly or overtly opposed many of Chiang's actions. While we do not possess the strength to destroy them outright like with the communists and other traitors, through political maneuvering their strength can be curbed and their influence weakened."
CHI_Expand_The_Central_Army:0 "중앙군 확장"
CHI_Expand_The_Central_Army_desc:0 "Large parts of China's army still remain de facto under the control of the warlords. This is, obviously, a threat to the central government's power. We must expand the central army that is under Chiang's direct control, to make sure that a warlord takeover or rebellion is not a real threat in the future."
CHI_Discredit_Local_Cliques:0 "지방 군벌 약화"
CHI_Discredit_Local_Cliques_desc:0 "Just as we strengthen central control, we must also weaken the provincial cliques across the country. Local cliques exercising extreme autonomy has caused much of the weakness of China in decades past, and this must come to an end. Local groups must be discredited and all the provinces of China must be brought into line under the Central Government and Chiang."
CHI_A_Fistful_Of_Democracy:0 "민주주의 한스푼"
CHI_A_Fistful_Of_Democracy_desc:0 "Of course, China is not yet ready for full democracy as dictated under the three principles of Sun Yat-sen. However, the people and some reformists demand some representation, and so we will give them what they want. Limited elements of democracy will be introduced, while it will be kept weak enough for us to maintain ultimate power above the democratic process."
CHI_The_One_Family:0 "하나의 가족"
CHI_The_One_Family_desc:0 "In the past, China has been dominated by strong and significant families. The old four big families of China consisted of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen. Now, as Chiang expands his control, the Chiang family will be brought to the forefront, above the other three. There will be one family above all."
CHI_Steal_Chengs_Work:0 "천청의 업적 가로채기"
CHI_Steal_Chengs_Work_desc:0 "Chen Cheng, the intellectual that he is, had designed various proposals for reforms to China's political system. While we cannot risk him gaining too much power, it would not be too hard to quietly copy his ideas and rebrand them as our own. Chiang's new reforms can take 'inspiration' from those of others."
CHI_Attention_to_the_Economy:0 "경제에 집중"
CHI_Attention_to_the_Economy_desc:0 "In recent times, China's economy has not been the most stable or most developed in the world. However, every great power needs a strong economy. With domestic threats having been in large part dealt with, economic policy can come to the forefront. We will make sure that the potential of China's economic resources are utilised and a powerful economy rises. "
CHI_Eternal_President:0 "영구 집권"
CHI_Eternal_President_desc:0 "Chiang Kai-shek's power has been significantly increased, and threats to his rule mostly removed. Now, he is the eternal president of China, being able to rule for life. Long live the eternal president!"
CHI_Extend_The_Martial_Law:0 "계엄령 연장"
CHI_Extend_The_Martial_Law_desc:0 "China has been in essentially a state of effective martial law since the restarted Chinese civil war. While elements of military control have been removed, some remain, and some have called for the total abandonment of martial law. However, for Chiang's rule to be assured, and for stability to be maintained, for now the involvement of the military in civilian society must remain in place."
CHI_The_Nanjing_Years:0 "난징의 해"
CHI_The_Nanjing_Years_desc:0 "From 1927 to 1937, the 'Nanjing decade' saw unparalleled stability and economic growth within China for the time, until the calamity of the war against Japan and the rise of the communists caused a significant setback. Now, with China not only stabilised but strengthened, and economic growth again increasing rapidly, the are new Nanjing years ahead of us."
CHI_Dynastic_Politics:0 "통치학"
CHI_Dynastic_Politics_desc:0 "장제스는 자신의 가문이 중국에서 가장 강력한 권력자로 주장했지만, 이제 우리는 한걸음 더 나아가야 합니다. 신뢰할수 있는 가족들에게 권력을 이양하고 안정을 유지하기 위해 정치 왕조가 만들어 질 것입니다. 장제스의 아들 장제스가 막강한 힘을 발휘할수 있도록 훈련을 받을 것입니다."
CHI_Growth_Above_Principles:0 "삼민주의 이상의 성장"
CHI_Growth_Above_Principles_desc:0 "With stability restored, the days of political principles are, really, over. The political process of restoring China to its rightful place have mostly run their course - now the time has come to expand China by non-political means. Economic growth will be sought after first and foremost and above any political considerations, to bring strength to the Chinese nation and prosperity to its people."
CHI_Committee_In_Disarray:0 "집행위원회의 혼란"
CHI_Committee_In_Disarray_desc:0 "\"The Tiger of Asia bestet by Vietnamese communists\" stated the headlines that rang in their heads. The glorious Republic of China Army after fighting for decades for the glory and unity of China at the supposed height of its power bestet by a country a couple hundred its size. The shame would probably be a black stain on both the Republic and its army for decades to come and none took more of the flak than the Generalissimo himself, Chiang Kai Shek. Suddenly the future of the Republic was shrouded in fog and already the powers behind the throne were making their moves..."

Each and every faction having widely different hopes and ideas as to how the path, if at all, should lead to the final implementation of Dr. Sun's three principles. With the Generalissimo stumbling and soon perhaps falling, long and deep cracks have appeared upon the visage of the white sun and soon it may break completely..."
CHI_Nanjing_Insanity:0 "난징의 광기"
CHI_Nanjing_Insanity_desc:0 "And on and on a silent round of poker went along in the streets of Nanjing, with every round each player betting something whether they wanted or not. Cliques convened, favors were pulled, assassinations planned until none of the puppet masters even knew anymore whether they were King or pawn. And on and on the rounds went knives were drawn, oaths sworn, loyalties affirmed, betrayed, new pieces appeared and vanished again. \n\nUntil all of the players had no more pawns and only queens to wager and suddenly, as if the passage of time that had been suspended for the last day (or weeks?), started running again once more, and in one fell swoop..."

As the dust settles over Nanjing, the first truly civilian government in half a century has seized control of China, and the bureaucrats that hold sway over the nation's institutions have extended that influence into the dizzying heights of power in China itself. As dissidents loyal to the old regime are chased out of power, the Bureaucrats must make a choice.\n\nTwo factions within the Political Science Clique are in disagreement over the direction China must take to secure itself against its enemies. Xiong Shihui, ever-amicable with the military, views an alliance with the generals as a necessity to destroy the Clique's opposition. Zhang Qun, the negotiator, prefers the use of greased palms to smoothen and subvert opposition in the Republic. The Clique faces a choice - and China hangs in the balance."
CHI_President_Zhang:0 "장 총통"
CHI_President_Zhang_desc:0 "The King of the Backroom Deals, Zhang Qun, has taken power in Nanjing. Our rival wings of the KMT have been relatively quick in acknowledging his victory, thanks to record-breaking new deals allowing the Huangpu and Tu Mu Cliques relative autonomy in provincial governance, and Xikang and Sichuan have been quick to propose regional 'special statuses' for their contributions to the National Treasury.\n\nZhang's belief in the power of a smiling face (and reasonable financial incentives to back it up) will reshape Chinese governance, emphasizing unity even further than the old Kuomintang ever dared. Increased diplomatic efforts abroad, a return to informal governance structures and the opening of massive discretionary funds will ensure China's stability - even if this stability is as entrenched in rot as the old order that preceded it."
CHI_President_Xiong:0 "슝 총통"
CHI_President_Xiong_desc:0 "President Xiong Shihui, the Friend of the Soldiers, has taken power in Nanjing. Already the military is scrambling to swear loyalty to the Government, and Jiangxi Province has been the first to officially recognize Xiong as head of state (no doubt related to his ties in the local administration). Xiong's belief in the power of the old order to reshape the new has lasting implications for all of the nation, as he begins to draw up plans for the merger of bureaucratic and military interests in China - with permanent effects on both.\n\nAs Xiong's personal interest group begins to outweigh all other domestic interests in policymaking influence, it is clear that the nation will come to resemble the tangled web of money, military force and bureaucratic control that is the President's inner circle. It might be a new day in Nanjing, but the dawn looks depressingly similar to that of the previous day's."

The Political Science Clique is in fact very well-versed in organising the subtle networks of power, influence and governance norms that comprise Chinese politics. Our manipulations simply take place on a realm far removed from the mundanity of political life. In truth, we are not building castles in the air; we are spinning wheels within wheels.\n\nAs the wheels spin, so too do the departments: regular shakeups of our highest ministries will assure the public that Something Is Being Done, and why would you ever question that, citizen? The country's leaders will write and rewrite their political theories, and although the paperwork will pile up and actual policymaking will struggle, China will walk closer to political perfection, true democracy, and enlightened governance."

For the sake of the country - and our political footing - this must end. An added clause to the Constitution formalizing boundaries between political parties and the government agencies they participate in will ensure that the corruption of party politics is kept far away from the core of the Republic.\n\nWe will, however, introduce Special Clauses into the Constitution to ensure that some parts of the Party are kept, ah, at a warm distance to the levers of power - for instance, bureaucrats with positions of power in the Kuomintang will be taken as neutral entities, capable of carrying out their duties to both the Constitution and the White Sun.

From now on, the Political Science Clique will move and strike as a united force in the halls of power. We will reorganize those departments in the Government, the Executive and Control Yuan in particular, to ensure bureaucratic dominance holds sway over every executive decision.\n\nWe must also take care to secure our flanks against opposition: changes to the operation of the National Assembly will strip rival factions of substantial privileges in the name of progress. Just to ensure that the independence of the executive branch is upheld, rival parties will also be, ah, monitored for subversive activities."

These are all true, to a certain extent, but they ignore one key fact: that the economy's structural dysfunction is the only thing keeping our regime afloat. And if the outcome of regime collapse is instability, surely anything is preferable to instability...\n\nThere is little that needs to be tweaked, and much that needs to be formalized. We will introduce deregulation to the banks and powerbrokers that keep our regime viable, allowing unbridled financial speculation on commodity trades, in exchange for significant shares in their corporate structures.

With leisure comes cuisine, of course: dedicated chefs will serve the finest food in China around the clock, with special provisions for seasonal cuisine.\n\nAllegations of widespread corruption affecting the building's contractors, massive untracked discretionary funds exchanged within the compound's walls, blackmail involving some very sensitive photographs with individuals in compromising situations within the Quarters, and outright extralegal trades in illegal substances within the unfinished compound abound. In downtown Nanjing there are even accusations of prominent opposition politicians entering the Quarters' bare walls and never coming out.\n\n§REvery last one of these charges is true.§!"

The parties of the Principled Opposition are already squabbling behind the scenes, weakened by endemic corruption and factionalism. That in itself will be insufficient to keep them from posing a threat to us, however.\n\nThere is, in the halls of the Presidential Palace, a folder of compromising intelligence we have gained on Western diplomats, some of it involving very sensitive dealings with certain Western aerospace firms. If a member of the Principled Opposition were to die in a regrettable accident, and if that folder were to be found in his possession by Western intelligence agents - we would be entirely correct in treating this matter as a subversive operation, and in allowing Western agents unlimited sanction in pacifying our obviously rogue political elements, would we not?"

His image haunts us still, reminding us of our unlamented predecessors in the halls of the Presidential Palace and stirring up elements in the Army who believe themselves patriotic. Even so, this undesirable situation might yet be turned to our advantage. We will begin to usurp the power of Chiang Kai Shek for our own, pulling him out in public to give speeches in support of our regime.\n\nIn a magnanimous act of reconciliation, we will even unveil official Chiang memorabilia in the Presidential Palace and in key government installations, honoring his legacy besides that of the Founder, Dr. Sun. A little greased palms (and perhaps a threat to his surviving family, to spice the message up a little) will leaven his former enmity towards us, and if we can incorporate the loyalists of his devoted fan base, well, the sky's the limit.

CHI_Military_Government_Cooperation:0 "군부-정부 협동"
CHI_Military_Government_Cooperation_desc:0 "The principle is simple: what is good for the country must be good for the army, and so the new Chinese Republic will surely only benefit if the Army is tied by the same strings as the Government. Tighter incorporation of the provincial armies into the affairs of state - like policing, for example, or the control of key political roles - will surely, by this line of logic, hone the efficacy of the State and make it stronger.\n\nThe old Chinese proverb rings true: when the state is rich, the army must be strong. We will ensure that the army, like the state, will be both strong and rich, as military commanders will receive better and higher integration into state institutions as their assistance to the President increases. The aim, of course, is to ensure that the military and state act with a single will in eliminating our many domestic enemies. The will of the President, that is. No one else matters."

When we were championing the cause of bureaucratic rule, the Party made every effort to resist us - in fact, their opposition to our reformist efforts was the one unifying factor that bunch of rogue sows has ever shared. Fragmented, regionalist and constantly at war with itself, it is as useless a support base as it was a vehicle for our ideals. We have no real need of them, and they have no place with us.\n\nThankfully, much like a divorce in real life, the spurned party will get the better part of the spoils. We will usurp the ideals, the imagery and the political clout of the Party, replacing key functionaries with our own in every regional branch, and then the Kuomintang will essentially be our puppet in all but name.

Our departments are understaffed, our institutions poorly-run and continually underfunded - who will keep track of the progress of our nation? Who will file the forms, who will perform the censuses, who will perform the spot-checks? If the nation needs military efficiency, then China has never needed us more!\n\nWe will bring the nation to heel by enforcing a unifying set of bureaucratic standards on key government installations: departments will be regulated and regularly spot-checked, every major urban centre will be regulated and taxed accordingly, and governmental institutions will be wrapped up in auspicious red tape.

We must hasten their transition to normalcy: what better way to do this than through the warm, stifling grip of paperwork?\n\nWe will create a new bureau to manage the Chinese economic machine, responsible for every major corporate entity residing in our territory, and this Bureau will be responsible for planning targets for economic output. We will also give the Bureau extraordinary powers to seize and claim unregistered and untaxed assets in the corporate realm, of course - and their seized revenue will sponsor the bureaucratic-military machine that keeps this country going."

A series of bills is already on its way to the National Assembly to debate this very issue, a debate which will only go one way.\n\nThe Military Benefits Act will give vast swathes of the country's confiscated private property, much of it belonging to industrialists and landowners who have compromised the Clique through their actions, to the Army. Land-plots will be distributed to senior Generals, and on certain pieces of land reserved for the most intimate of friends with President Xiong, even the law of the Republic will be suspended.\n\nThe extraordinary uses to which said land could then be put, like human trafficking, say, or even trade in certain illegal narcotics - we will leave that to the fevered imaginations of the journalists."

The Act includes regulations on the size of the Assembly's legal majorities and pluralities, fleshes out the use of ordinary and extraordinary executive powers, and proposes a grand expansion to the Control Yuan's data management system to help it manage its new mandate.\n\nThe members of our Clique actually in the Control Yuan are, of course, dutifully celebratory - and they will continue to be celebratory as we funnel funds into the Control Yuan to keep the juggernaut afloat. In fact, as we prepare to hold elections, the Control Yuan will also take on the role of eliminating subversive elements from the census rolls in advance.

In fact, when these rallies begin to get out of hand, we will generously prepare their exit before they become a public health and safety nuisance.\n\nThe elections themselves will be relatively simple to conduct: villages, towns and cities will be allocated ballots on the provincial level, and in a first-past-the-post system the winner will be chosen from a majority of elected provinces. Armed guards will ensure the process stays free and fair every step of the way, advising citizens on how to vote, moving ballot boxes into undisclosed locations to ensure the papers are intact, and then conducting impromptu quality checks to dispose of unwanted waste-paper.

They are so weak, in fact, that unless we want to be considered full-on authoritarians we must boost their legitimacy to give them a semblance of dignity.\n\nLike the scholar-gentry who heroically gives his cloak to a starving beggar, we will afford the Opposition generosity by loosening their electoral restrictions and granting select amnesties to members. Strict background checks and a certain degree of wholly justified surveillance will ensure that these members are totally innocent of crimes against the State and harmlessly inept.

Perhaps a closer look at our regime's intangible relations with its stakeholders is in order, and a reassessment of how much we can afford to devote to maintain these relations.\n\nThere is one area in which we can afford to give our Honored Constituents even more concessions. Tax cuts across the board, especially for the banking-industrial complexes of the major cities, will ensure that our friends in the financial world are well-rewarded for their loyalty for the regime, and further loosening of restrictions on the upper-class will make them virtually a new aristocracy unto themselves.

CHI_Handling_Political_Unrest_desc:0 "The fallout of our folly in Vietnam is, to be blunt, an absolute disaster with not just the heads of the KMT at each other's throats but widespread protests and riots. With the remaining communist forces on the mainland profiting handsomely off of it. \n\nBut President Chen is not just a fearsome war hero and a smooth talking charmer but also a man with a plan..."
CHI_The_Cheng_Plans:0 "첸의 계획"
CHI_The_Cheng_Plans_desc:0 "The Chen plan, incorporating some elements such as land reforms already proposed by President Chen for years, is aimed at resolving the wide ranging problems grieving our republic - namely reconciling with the people via social reforms, as well as after a decade of peace finally moving towards fulfilling the three principles Dr Sun devised so long ago."
CHI_Unity_Through_Peace:0 "평화를 위한 단결"
CHI_Unity_Through_Peace_desc:0 "The stick that is the martial law and oppression by the police has hit the people for far too long, not only eroding the people's will and betraying the trust they placed onto us to lead China into a better future but the very ideals of Dr Sun himself. Under President Chen's tenure we shall instead focus on true peace and harmony in the land, not one enforced at the barrel of a gun."
CHI_National_Revolution:0 "중화국민혁명"
CHI_National_Revolution_desc:0 "The national revolution begun by Dr Sun and his compatriots so long was not just fulfilled with us defeating the communist menace at last. No, Dr Sun did not just envision for us to simply do away with the Qing court but to also rage against the trapping of the past that made China weak and subservient to western and eastern power. With our people regaining the trust lost under Chiang it is time to resume this."
CHI_Stabilizing_the_KMT:0 "국민당 안정화"
CHI_Stabilizing_the_KMT_desc:0 "Almost at the verge of collapsing thanks to infighting, it will take some serious effort to mend the factional rifts currently plaguing the KMT and more importantly keeping it that way. With the Generalissimo's blessing allowing President Chen some leeway as to crack down on worst offenders and uniting them behind his vision of a new China, at least for now."
CHI_Dream_of_Democracy:0 "민주주의의 꿈"
CHI_Dream_of_Democracy_desc:0 "The second of Dr Sun's principles, disregarded by all sides of the civil war out of sheer necessity, was for too long suspended under Generalissimo Chiang in times of peace. With China finally becoming truly united once more, who are we to spit at not just Dr Sun's legacy but the very will of the people? Under President Chen's tenure the KMT shall work as one to finally realize that elusive second principle."
CHI_Meet_With_The_Students:0 "학생들과의 만남"
CHI_Meet_With_The_Students_desc:0 "The student protesters whilst reviled by most of the heads of the KMT have very legitimate grievances and wishes for the future. With President Chen seeing things much the same them, for he too wishes for a fulfillment of the third principles and discarding the policies of yore that exclusively focused on economic growth. \n\nWhilst nowhere near as radical as the students, politics are always but a game of compromise and with the parties beliefs aligning so closely surely there will be an agreement satisfactory for all."
CHI_Allow_Land_Reforms:0 "토지개혁 허용"
CHI_Allow_Land_Reforms_desc:0 "Land reforms have long been a tricky topic in China, with the peasants clearly suffering under the rampant exploitation of the land owners. A fact amply exploited by the communist menace of course. Yet we are not like them nor do we desire to take pages out of their horrid playbook, instead in a manner most befitting to President Chen we shall reach an agreement beneficial to all: lighter land reforms shall be greenlit as well as capping the rent the farmers owe to their landlords at 37.5%."
CHI_Under_One_Banner:0 "하나의 가치 아래서"
CHI_Under_One_Banner_desc:0 "Despite China fracturing and warring between itself myriad times throughout history, the dream of a unified China under one banner always remained eternal.

China will be truly whole once more and when it is the Tiger's roar shall shake the entire world!"

CHI_Monetary_Reforms_desc:0 "How could China's economy be strong if not just our industry is still in its infancy but the very money we use everyday is corrupted from the core? With inflation being not just a herd of clouds on the horizon but a snake that could every day bury her fangs into us, we must act sooner rather than later. Whilst like much of our administration this can only serve as a first step we must nonetheless offer some relief."

CHI_Reorganize_the_NRA_desc:0 "The National Revolutionary Army served us and the country valiantly following the decades of Yuan Shikai's betrayal. Marching and bleeding unendingly till every single foe that would keep China weak and betray it to foreign powers lay broken or dead. Yet the prospect of power corrupts all it seems, and under the treachery of He Yingqing and other militaries the NRA almost turned against the very country the swore to protect.

CHI_Rethinking_New_Life_Movement_desc:0 "Starting in 1934 the New Life movement, designed by Generalissimo Chiang and his wife, advocated a new life guided by four virtues, proper rite, righteousness, honesty and cleanness and shame. Aiming to instill moral and unifying virtues within the populace to revitalize China and act as a bulwark against the communist menace, the campaign ultimately ended in failure thanks to the general and foreign public largely dismissing its virtues as trite. \n\nYet the need to revitalize and unite China is still as paramount as twenty years ago, alas perhaps it is time to revitalize the movement itself?"
CHI_Second_Industrial_Revolution:0 "2차 산업혁명"
CHI_Second_Industrial_Revolution_desc:0 "The first industrial revolution saw Europe and later America soar by much of the world, with their endless legions of iron greedily tearing our nation apart. Later other countries such as the accursed japanese joined in kind, with China thanks to the incompetence of the Qing falling to the wayside. Whilst we gained some of their strength such as under the Nanjing decade, China still lacks behind much of the world. We shall now make active efforts to change that."
CHI_Education_Reforms:0 "교육 개혁"
CHI_Education_Reforms_desc:0 "Despite our and the republicans of yore's efforts, much of China is still in the grip of ancient traditions. And nowhere is this as apparent as in our schooling system with the scholar classes of yore still dominating much of schools, with the poorer populace simply needing their children as helping hand to make the everyday expenses met. \n\nExtending the compulsory education and providing more money to the schooling system, whilst unpopular, will hopefully break up some of these structures."
CHI_The_Designer_Of_China:0 "중국의 설계자"
CHI_The_Designer_Of_China_desc:0 "President Chens vision for China goes much beyond simply fixing the Republic's most glaring issues, for he knows full well that if not a stable foundation is built, every house is doomed to corruption and collapse eventually. The final part of his plan envisions just that: casting the idealistic foundation that led to the overthrow of the Qing into stone and making sure the Republic shall uphold their struggle and vision for all time. With that China shall be truly unified and we shall march as one towards greatness!"

CHI_Social_Reforms:0 "Social Reforms"

As such our unending efforts to bring China into the twentieth century do not end in the realm of the material, old restrictive structures must be broken up gently so as to not jeopardize the new unity of China and excesses must be curbed. For what good is the first principle if the people can only thing about the boot of their better?"
CHI_Labour_Laws:0 "노동법"
CHI_Labour_Laws_desc:0 "While fundamentally misguided, the Communists were not completely detached from reality. The fact is that for millions of our people the confucian rooted principles allowed for much exploitation and hardship not just from people's landowners but also their bosses, a fact they amply exploited during the civil war, allowing them to sway many to their side. What good is the second principle if the people are reigned dictatorially in their workplace?"

Chiang's influence has seeped into nigh all of them and only cleansing fire can save the ailing house that has become the Kuomintang! \n\nYet, we must also tread carefully.

CHI_Dismantling_The_Cliques_desc:0 "From the Central Club to the Huang Pu to the Blue Shirts, the cliques whilst churning inner party democracy have long overreached their area of expertise, employing brutal measures and intrigue to retain their grip on power. This came most prominently to the fore in the wake of Chiangs fall, with the Nanjing Insanity almost rendering our country asunder. \n\nOf course filling the holes they left will be a difficult task, with much expertise leaving us as well.

CHI_Pacify_the_Masses_desc:0 "The Vietnam War, the insanity of Nanjing and then President Li's blunt ultimatum to the nepotists and kleptocrats of China all have destabilized and made the people lose hope in government.

CHI_Improve_the_Laws:0 "중국 법률 개선"
CHI_Improve_the_Laws_desc:0 "The chinese laws have been for centuries vague and nebulous, with various loopholes allowing the corrupt and greedy of the officials to slip in their own interpretation of things. As such it comes as no surprise that large swathes of the population dislike or even despise the bureaucratic and judicial trappings.

Naval bombardment could take place at further distances than ever thought possible, making our ships invulnerable to conventional anti-ship measures.\n\nOf course, this is really far easier said than done. The development of these nascent missile systems is projected to take 20 years even in far better research environments than ours.

Heavy, heavy reliance on our American aviation partners has also given us access to talented individuals, some of them expatriates linked to our Flying Tigers, that should give us insider access into the American aviation industry as well.\n\nIt will be a long process, and the path to genuine airpower will be rocky, but the road to Shu has always been harder than the road to Heaven.

Innovative designs suggest that a type of rotor like the propellers that support our planes could, if set over the chassis, provide rapid lift and descent capabilities. More importantly, these designs could hover above battlefronts, providing covering fire and visual targeting to ground units, and lifting units to safety upon the termination of combat.\n\nThis could, to put it bluntly, revolutionize warfare - and China cannot afford to be late to this Revolution.

What is needed is a means to engage the enemy long before he is in sight, so that our air superiority can be enforced without threat.\n\nThe AIM-series missile prototypes developed in American facilities have therefore proven of significant interest to us.

The specifics of fighter production, including the positioning of engines and the alloy composition of the wing itself, will take some time to adjust to perfection.\n\nOnce we are done, however… there is much to be invested in, and much to be redeveloped.

CHI_Cheap_Labour_desc:0 "One advantage of our rural industrial efforts is that the workforce we are drawing upon are desperate for work and chronically financially insecure. This means, of course, that we will need to pay them far less than their fat-bellied complacent counterparts from the cities: our companies are already reporting massive profit opportunities from the systemic exploitation of the countryside! A small sacrifice for the workers, but invaluable for our export economy, to be sure."

With every roll of copper wire from a Dongbei factory, the whole of the Nation prospers, and with every missed business deal our Ancestors groan with the loss. Why should the humble workers, therefore, bear the brunt of our struggle with nothing to show for it? Expanded labor protection laws will ensure that the Chinese nation is united, in opportunity, welfare and hope for the coming future!"

CHI_Enrich_Some_First_desc:0 "Let us always remember that while the Nation affords all a role in society, some roles are more equal than others. Who should be rewarded for our innovation and efficiency if not the juggernauts who have brought the market into being? Should the corporate master not receive adequate compensation for the delicate artwork of his industry? Yes, we shall pour the fruits of our investments into the beautiful elite: lowered corporate taxes and expanded production licenses will prove that to get rich in China is truly glorious!"

The hearts of the people pump as one, hundreds of millions rushing towards a single goal - the prosperity of the Republic and the Peace of China! As the factories sprout across the mountains and valleys, let the world behold the Chinese Miracle: our nation, like a dragon, ascends towards the clouds. Let heaven tremble at the thought."

CHI_Guizhou_Guangxi_Railway_desc:0 "In the Chongqing Era, the rail-line to Guangxi was not just an ordinary transport artery: it was the lifeline of the Republic itself, and the lives of millions rode on its operation. Alas, the State has allowed this railway to, ah, go to pot, to put it bluntly. The long project of restoring this rail-line has been chaotic and filled with corruption, such that more than five years - five years! - of work has resulted in negligible progress.\n\nThis is a travesty to the Nation, an embarrassment to the Government, and just cause for the firing of the Commission in its entirety. Unfortunately, the replacement of 1 Commissioner alone will not quite do the job for us: a direct state-managed project will require time, treasure and massive, massive amounts of bureaucracy."

CHI_The_Currency_Issue:0 "화폐 문제"
CHI_The_Currency_Issue_desc:0 "All politics, in the end, is economic in nature. If that is true, then China's political future looks gloomy indeed - for the Chinese Dollar, long subject to excessive supply and poor investor confidence, is spiralling downwards in value. If we do not act soon, we will face a collapse of domestic economic confidence, a withdrawal of investments from the new nation, and all manner of instability. \n\nIf we are to keep China, we must start with the Yuan. There, and only there, can we build the foundations of a strong and independent nation - for is not a nation bound to its finances as the teeth are to the gums?"
CHI_Government_Intervention:0 "정부의 개입"
CHI_Government_Intervention_desc:0 "Under the conditions of the Liberation War, we were forced to assume far more libertarian fiscal stances than H. H. Kung had ever wanted - to pay for wartime bills and buffer our military industry, freeflow printing of money became the norm for several dizzying years of inflationary pressure. Now that the consequences of this imprudence have become apparent, it is time to step in and actively constrict the supply of currency - to ensure stability of the currency in the short term, nothing less than a full-on freeze in the financial cycle is necessary. \n\nIt might be unpopular, it might result in precipitous drops in consumer savings, and it might even, in a few localized areas, result in temporary depressions. But bitter medicine always works best - and if we do not act as the doctor, the whole nation will soon burn away in its fevers."
CHI_Stop_the_Printing:0 "발권 중지"
CHI_Stop_the_Printing_desc:0 "The first step to controlling the value of currency is its supply. And the biggest contributor to money supply in the domestic economy is, as ever, the Government. The widespread practice of local printing to supply bank loans, domestic payments to agencies and payrolls must end - but this alone is not enough. After critical examination of our banking system, our Financial Ministry has issued a recommendation to force through prompt payments of debt at an appointed date. \n\nThis move is well-nigh guaranteed to cause problems, and has already created mild bubbles in business confidence as people whisper of foreclosures and sudden freezes in liquidity. It will not be pleasant - but the necessary is seldom pleasant, and we are foresworn to do what is necessary for the nation."
CHI_Rebuilding_the_Trust:0 "신뢰 재구축"
CHI_Rebuilding_the_Trust_desc:0 "As our country reels from the temporary liquidity crisis we have generated, our Ministry has proposed an accelerated programme to recapture consumer and investor confidence. From Shenyang to Guangzhou, we will introduce spectacular demand-side programmes to spur consumption and reinvestment into the economy; local governments will build bridges, roads and housing blocks and pay businesses to do so. If the private sector is too afraid to invest, then the Nation must lead the way! \n\nOur programmes must also target the unstable incomes of much of China's working class - through parallel programmes designed to mediate commodity pricing, we will begin to rebuild the shattered wallets of a swathe of the Chinese population. It will be extremely expensive, and it will be painful for our already strained coffers - but it will in the end prove beneficial."
CHI_The_Currency_Question:0 "화폐개혁"
CHI_The_Currency_Question_desc:0 "Our current attempts at reforming the finances of China have proven moderately successful, but our Western-aligned modern economists whisper of a better, more long lasting solution to be undertaken. Ambitious though it might be, the plan is simple: a New Chinese Dollar, or perhaps the Sun-Yat-Sen Dollar, will fully transition the nation's economy into the new system (and also help us uproot any hoarders of commodities or the old currency). It will also firmly delineate our transition into a new era, which should aid our nation-building efforts in the political sphere. \n\nThat said, there are definite downsides to this project - we have just barely managed to stabilize our economy from inflationary pressures and low consumer confidence. Kicking the proverbial hornet's nest will jeopardize our extant policies, and might risk a lapse back into the depression of the immediate post-war years. It is a gamble. Are we ready to bet the house?"
CHI_Issue_Treasury_Bonds:0 "재무부 채권 발행"
CHI_Issue_Treasury_Bonds_desc:0 "The Treasury is critical to sponsoring the small-scale Keynesian programmes we are implementing across China - as the biggest single investor in the nation and the sole guarantor of much of its currency, it holds the key to our success or failure. To keep it financially viable, we will institute mandatory bond-trading in our financial markets, selling guaranteed-return loans to the government with the promise of stable interest. Thanks to our recent financial reforms, we are guaranteed a relatively stable valuation as well - or so the eggheads tell us. \n\nThe Government will not stop there, however. Complex securities, borrowed from the American system, are in the works - these are explicitly tied to the value of inflation, further increasing consumer confidence in their yields. With these soft instruments, we will prod the Chinese fiscal juggernaut into roaring, vital life."
CHI_A_Stable_Currency:0 "안정 통화"
CHI_A_Stable_Currency_desc:0 "The blueprints have been drawn, the guidelines set, the financial institutions nurtured to health - it is time we declared victory over inflation. With an official transition to secondary priorities like industrial development and expansion of infrastructure, we will take our place amongst the fellow developing nations of the world as a stable, beckoning source of consumer confidence. The new plan is to boost domestic industrial growth in a manner championed by our domestic economists. They call it import-substitution, and it might just be the future. \n\nThey say high tariffs and a ramp-up of domestic industry will secure our currency from within. They say the Chinese market could, for the first time in a century, be the tiger that rides the world rather than bowing before it. They say the markets of Shanghai and Wuchang will soon become nexuses of international trade and investment, and that when China gives orders - the world will be led by its wallets. \n\nAnd, as the Vermillion Dragon begins to flex in his slumber, it is looking like they may be right."
CHI_Non_Intervention:0 "불간섭 정책"
CHI_Non_Intervention_desc:0 "The free-er the markets, the free-er the people - although Western-styled liberalization is very far from our present concerns at the moment, the wallets of China are a very relevant priority. And, studies suggest, the freewheeling state of affairs governing China's economy could in fact be made to benefit consumer confidence. Only minute tweaks to the fiscal system are required, not huge, destabilizing changes. If we thought otherwise, we'd have kept faith with the Communists, wouldn't we? \n\nThe Banks of China will be key to this: through their adept usage of commodities, stocks and other monetary alternatives, they have almost single-handedly kept China's financial sector afloat. We shall encourage the banks to continue doing so, even as we look into something our economists call \"provincial financing\" to replicate the same effect on the local level with small loans. And the Government shall not have to waste a single Dollar!"
CHI_Embracing_Inflation:0 "인플레이션 수용"
CHI_Embracing_Inflation_desc:0 "Really, if we think about it, inflation isn't so bad, isn't it? If money is just an arbitrary estimation of value, then an increase or decrease in this number doesn't mean anything. China might have invented paper currency, but its assets have always lain in better things than money - like the strength of our textile and agrarian markets. With all this in mind, perhaps the latest numbers from our Economists shouldn't worry us too much. \n\nIn fact, when we analyse the details, what we see here is the trimming of excess, not the loss of potential! Collapsing consumer confidence, mass unemployment exploding thanks to uncertainty over payroll numbers, the failure of our loan schemes due to aforementioned collapse in confidence - only a little falling-in of the unsustainable heights of our economic fortress, to protect the greater, stronger whole. \n\nYes, it's really nothing to worry about. And as for the foreign firms looking to invest - well, our stocks have quite literally never been higher, have they?"
CHI_Floated_Economic_Growth:0 "유동적인 경제 성장"
CHI_Floated_Economic_Growth_desc:0 "China is the meat, and the world the carving table and knife. So it has been and so it shall ever be, given that international investment is increasingly dominant in what is left of our economy. That said, there are methods to, ah, maximize the opportunity this vulnerability brings us. \n\nA floated exchange rate, one whose value relative to foreign currencies is dictated by market demand and supply, could bring us stability and much longed-for consumer confidence, and stabilize the value of our currency alternatives. More importantly, it would open the market to foreign investments and allow us to focus on domestic interest rates on currency - all of which would buffer the shockwaves rippling through the small markets of China. \n\nIt is unpopular, to say the least, even exploitative. But in the long run this will only benefit us. Eventually."

Where else could he be from? Despite his best attempts the Jiangsu accent was clear as water on his tongue.\n\nAfterwards they thankfully ended the charade, with the boys from Nanjing holding having infiltrated most of the administration, the mask was largely dropped. With him being suddenly expected to take orders from and show respect to people way below his rank and age. Somewhat embarrassing really considering their special effort beforehand to remain as innocuous as they could. But Yan did not really care nor complain, what he cared for was keeping his job and he had done well to please his new bosses. He felt no shame in such acts, after all such things as Mr. Chen had done were all too common in history."

All those hours rummaging through the records and asking a favour of this and that had finally culminated in this. The letter was addressed to Chiang Wei-kuo, son of the Generalissimo. He began to read it aloud to himself.\n\n\"You are a fraud Chiang Wei-kuo. You claim to be the son of our glorious Generalissimo, yet I know the truth. Your real father is Dai Jitao. Of course this is not the worst part is it? If you still don't take me seriously, I shall simply say two words.\"\n\n\"Shigematsu Kaneko\"\n\n\"I know about her, and what you really are. You will never know how I know, for I know everything about you. I know what's written on every letter you write to your father, even the one you haven't written yet.\"\n\n\"I have official evidence and all it will take is one phone call. Just think of the scandal. Of course, none of that needs to happen, so long as you sign a few documents and officially support myself and the Central Club within the party. If you don't, count your career as good as dead. I look forward to hearing your reply.\nRegards, the CC.\"\n\nChen so wished he could see the teutonic twit's face when he first read it. Satisfied with his work, he took up his pen and paper to write a second letter. Time to remind Chiang Ching-kuo of some of his less than savory activities during the Shanhai clear up operations."

The restaurant aimed more for European finery, it being filled with chandeliers and grand yet almost tacky decor. Most of the food on offer was a take on a European meal, but a few more traditional meals were also offered. The man had been sure to be very specific with his order as instructed.\n\nFinally a waiter appeared. He approached very gingerly with his food, a simple cashew chicken. The waiter placed it down as quickly as he could, and left. Upon inspection he could spot the almost ridiculous amount of spring onion. Upon tasting it, he could also detect the extra cashew nuts. His curiosity fulfilled, he lifted the plate up and felt the bottom. He felt paper, removed it and opened the letter he found in his hands. It contained two photos.\n\nThe first photo showed a man possibly approaching or just passing 50. His hair is swooped back, yet clearly thinning. He seems to be wearing one of the newer, more fashionable uniforms the man had seen on occasion. Especially around the army offices within Nanjing. Overall the man pictured in the photo seemed a composed, well kept individual. His face seemed to ring some bells, though the man at the booth couldn't name him from memory. The second photo showed something he could name however, the entrance to the Jiangnan Examination Hall. On the back of the first photo was a detailed message.\n\n\"Target will take part in a ceremony at Jiangnan Examination Hall. At 14:30, the target shall take to the stand for a short speech. Make your move when convenient. Equipment provided on location, as promised. Half of your payment will also be found there. The second half will be provided here after the job is done. Destroy this letter upon reading. Happy hunting, the Central Club sends its regards.\"\n\nThe man was satisfied. He took one last look at the photo, finished his food, paid his bill, and made to leave. This was just like the good old days in the mid-1930s. He sometimes missed those midnight meetings around the Salt Palace in Hsingking."

The screams as the general is dragged outside silence the entire court. It appears the Blueshirt Police is having its merry way with him. After five minutes or so the voice peters out into a steady whimper, and then into nothingness. The judge continues, a look of mild annoyance on his face.\n\nLi half-smiles to the guards, whispering conspiratorially if they will be let off-shift early tonight for what they are about to do.

He is unquestioning through it all, gentle even.\n\nLi Zongren knew, from the moment Dai Li seized power from him, that he and his clique were dead men walking.

We have always been ready to grasp fate by the neck - in 1937, when Generalissimo Chiang was kidnapped, we were ready to seize the apparatus of state. When I was offered the opportunity to lead the Statistics and Investigation Bureau, I took it, because I knew it would only build our power here.\"\n\nThe spymaster nods, as if affirming some hidden truth to his disciples, and continues. \"And now, friends, this is where those patient years of struggle have led us. Chiang is once again indebted to us, and once again history is within our grasp. But opportunity must be grasped by the elect. And I have heard thoughts, yes, even from some of you, that Chiang himself is no longer a member of the elect. Nanjing itself can no longer resist us.

Day after day he shows up to work, armed with formidable proposals for the betterment of the Nation and the progress of the Chinese people. The optimism is perhaps a ploy to protect him from ambitious Blueshirts, who do not take optimists very seriously, but Ching-Kuo draws strength from it. Perhaps Wang is the only person left in the Chinese Government who is truly committed to good; in any event, Ching-Kuo draws much strength from their policy discussions, which invariably end with Chiang smiling and saying some variation of \"Well, perhaps some time in the future...\"\n\nWang is in the President's favourite chair, talking animatedly about his latest set of infrastructure proposals, when Dai Li shows up.

The quota for today would be met when the President arrived - it would have to be, or the Bosses would have strong words for them all, and a cardboard box to carry them out.\n\nAs Chen Cheng walked into the building at noon, he met a vista of smiling faces and an immaculate factory: everything seemed almost to sparkle, the daily products of engine-machinery were laid in military rows, and the workers bore identical expressions of mild reverence. At their head, of course, was the Manager: and with a wisdom that seemed beyond his youth the latter amused Chen Cheng with his stories of hard living.\n\n\"I like what you've done with the place, young man.\" The President shook his hand as he turned to leave. \"Let me know if you'll ever come into politics: we could use drivers like you!\"\n\nJiang Zemin chuckled and shook his head.

The proposal is ambitious, and as far as the Kuomintang can be said to have a political 'left', considerably slanted in that political direction.\n\nAside from the issue of land reform, almost every conceivable aspect of rural infrastructure and economy has been tackled in this Bill. Salary reforms will target local and international firms, forcing employees to be paid a liveable wage; ambitious pension fund plans will provide a stable basis to support the ever-growing veteran base; additional reforms on the banking system will ensure more equitable access to loans and more generous terms for their perusal. Rural farmers will also receive heavy development incentives to encourage the mechanization of agriculture and limited internal tariffs to ensure they receive high prices for their goods.\n\nIt is so ambitious, in fact, that it is nearly laughed out of the Assembly. As the Representatives gradually realise that the President and Premier are, in fact, deadly serious about this, the discussion switches to disbelief.

twrchinazongren.6.d:0 "It's sunset in Saigon, and the thunder of rickshaws heralds the end of another working day. Sweating laborers struggle to pull businessmen, wives and children across the paved roads, while the occasional car attempts to clear its way through them all. It is an old scene, but in many places jarringly new elements are present: Red banners are arrayed across the buildings of the Commercial District, bearing slogans as clunky as they are optimistic. Party cadres give out pamphlets on the sidewalks, shouting at workers to attend their weekly ideological sessions and laughing with each other in calculated bursts of theatrical joy.\n\nSaigon is a new city now, and it breathes new life into all it touches. But not everyone welcomes the change. In a secluded house in the suburbs, two middle-aged men sit on a couch, playing cards as the cigarette smoke coils above them. The letter from Nanjing sits between them, untouched. Neither of them really want to acknowledge its existence. They know, at least in part, what the letter represents.\n\nOne man throws down a series of cards, and the other groans. \"Goddamnit, Ye, you could've told me you had a royal flush. Playing Da Lao Er with two people? A recipe for disaster.\" Ye grins, almost wolfishly, and reaches for the thin roll of bills placed at the far end of the coffee-table. \"No wonder you want a post money economy…\"As Ye counts his money - its' worthless, old coinage from the Yan'an days - Liu Shaoqi, head of the Communist Party of China's Vietnam Branch, reaches for the letter. He opens it, flicks through the pages. Doubt vanishes - this is exactly what he had expected, but to experience it for real is still a sobering experience.\n\nHe looks at Ye Jianying, former General, now a refugee. All of them are refugees now. \"Pack your things, gather the men we have left. The Guangxi Clique has taken over, and Nanjing wants to talk.\""

Isolationism might not be healthy in the long run for a country's economy, but it certainly has brought peace to this part of the Republic.\n\nThat is the Ministry, at least. The silent, monstrous machine of covert affairs around and within it, its operations latticed around the nations of Asia, is far more noisy than even the largest Ministry in Nanjing. The Bureau of Investigation and Statistics is everywhere. And its capabilities - well, threats - are limitless. So it is a ZhongTeJu agent who delivers the final report to the President, in the end, and not a diplomat from the Vietnamese Republic.\n\nHis secretary hisses at him to enter a semi-darkened room somewhere in the bowels of Nanjing, and the bemused Li enters, flanked by bodyguards selected for their loyalty to the President first, the Republic second, and the Bureau preferably last. A hooded figure follows, his eyes hidden through aviator glasses. He shakes hands with the President, and having dispensed with the formalities he gets to business.\n\nThe choice for the CCP separatists, he says, was obvious from the get-go. The Vietnam Branch's men are tired, burned out and homesick. Ye Jianying, Liu Shaoqi - they asked for concessions, but in the end they need us more than we need them. We want their support. They want to go home.\n\nThe hooded figure nods simply, writing on a notepad a date and time, and then he is gone. His words hang in the wind: Be ready, President."

As Li Zongren is preparing to make a speech to formally begin today's session, the main Yuan building is once again surrounded by demonstrators demanding an end to martial law and further reforms. Within the crowd, sparse groups of blue shirted individuals shuffle their way through unnoticed. Making their way to the restricted side entrance, they quietly overpower the understaffed security detachment. As Zongren finishes his speech to the sound of roaring applause from his compatriots in the Yuan, Dai Li storms into the chambers with a pistol in hand. Rushing to the podium and firing his gun at the ceiling, the Legislative Yuan quickly goes silent as they notice all the exits are blocked by blueshirts. Dai Li announces a dissolution of the Yuan and arrest of the \"decadent kleptocrats\" that have poisoned China for decades. Outraged by the putsch, Zongren storms the stage brandishing a knife. After quickly being hit with a rifle butt and dragged away bleeding, Dai Li orders his followers across the country to seize every major city. by 11:00 AM, Blueshirts loyal to Dai Li are marching in every city square in China."

Dressed in his thin overalls and a tattered Party jacket, he cuts a lean figure, half-shivering against the stiff breeze. At least the journalists, he thinks, have been kept off the scene. For all intents and purposes, he's travelling to the country that expelled him as a private resident, albeit one with an entourage of several dozen bedraggled veterans.\n\nLi Zongren, of course, is there to meet him. Liu remembers his broad face from all those years back in the Central Committee days, in heated discussions over the next Japanese incursion, the movement of troops in the South and East. He's grown a little paunchier, the creases around his eyes a little deeper, but otherwise he hasn't aged a day. Now he bounds over, smiling with what must have been practiced ease, calling to Liu to come and see the rest of the city.\n\nThe city is somehow both smaller and larger than Liu remembers from the photos. The buildings are compact, the streets bear traces of reworking and seem narrower somehow in the new skyscrapers' shadows - but the city is teeming with life, from the government bureaucrats to the businessmen running through the alleyways. It's all he can do not to stare out the window.\n\nAs their convoy pulls up outside the Presidential Palace, Li pulls out a rumpled dossier, tossing it with almost careless ease. Liu thumbs through the pages, frowning.\"These terms seem a little, well, generous. I had not expected the right to create our own political party, nor did I expect full amnesty to our lower ranked members-\"\n\n\"I wouldn't call them generous if I were you.\" Zongren is staring straight ahead, and the jolliness has vanished from his features. \"If you sign this, you'll be declaring the legitimacy of our government. From what I understand of you Reds, this statement is as good as a surrender.\" The President turns to him, face cold. \"And I'll make sure all of China knows it.\""

According to the President's office, CCP members will be granted amnesty and be allowed to return to China. They will be granted the right to organize their own political party. In return for this however, Shaoqi has agreed to formally recognize the Guangxi regime as the legitimate government of China. With news reporters from around the world present to observe the event, Shaoqi approached the press and stated \"With this agreement our tired and homesick comrades from all over the world can finally return to their families.\""

twrchinazongren.11.d:0 "Excerpt, Memoirs Of A Traitor, Dong Cunrui, Tsingtau University Press\n\nOnce, when I was a child, my father caught me trying to throw stones at birds clustered in a neighbour's garden. I remember thinking that if I threw hard enough, and if I could hit the right spot on some defenseless bird, I would have to crawl through the pickets of the fence to retrieve it. Then, I believed, I would stand in the garden like it was my own, feeling the grass and the mud on my toes. It would belong to me, and I to it.\n\nAnd yet when my father understood this, he did not deny me this as punishment - he merely promised that I would get the chance to walk through the world like I owned it, one day. On that day, he said, it would not matter whether I was rich or poor, a soldier or a craftsman or a thief. I would be one with all the men and women who walk through this life and, for a brief, shining instant in time, find their place within it.\n\nWhen we heard the news from Shaoqi and his deputies, that instant came to me. I fell on the floor, weeping with joy, and it was quite a while before I could be calmed down. Even as the terms and conditions were read aloud to us, I felt the life coming back to me in that crowded repurposed shophouse in Saigon. The world had long shifted away from my feet, and at last it was moving towards some semblance of order.\n\nOld cadres, ripped from us by the ravages of war and reconstruction. Our rivers and mountains, after the long nightmare of the Defeat, finally regained. Even the opportunity to start anew, a new Party, free of the gunfire that stained us all after these years of struggle. And a just, lasting peace, one where we could slough off the stains of the past.\n\nAs I watched President Li sign the Charter of Armistice, I felt my heart lift, and for an instant I was standing in the garden, just like I had dreamed all those years ago - my feet muddy with earth, my soul blessedly free."

China's vast network of money and old power was long the source of stability for the Political Science Clique: money fed the soldiers, power kept them in line. Money quietened the governors, and power silenced them. Money and power. They are a winning recipe, if used in moderation. But the Clique is approaching the limits of moderation.\n\nDemonstrations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou every other week, fuelled by discontent over elections that end in results contradictory to public sentiment. An antsy business community watches as the third consecutive motion to protect key banks from financial accountability stalls in the National Assembly. A wave of public nostalgia for an order that at least pretended to be a party of the People. In faraway Urumqi, a Governor's mansion is burnt to the ground, the third incident of arson in a month. An old banner, long forbidden and long desired, spreads its hammer-sickled face to the four winds on its burning roof.\n\nThe Bureaucrats, like men on a sinking ship, rush to fill the holes. A member of the Principled Opposition, if it can be called opposition at all, will replace President [CHI.GetLeader] as he bows low in the nation's television screens. But who will that member be?\n\nJiang Menglin, agricultural expert and ex-President of Zhejiang University, is a reluctant candidate, distant from even opposition politics. He will accept only because the Clique keeps tabs on his personal finances, but he will accept in the end. Wang Shijie, on the other hand, is enthusiastic: an old stooge from the KMT days, he has proved invaluable in whipping his party into covert collaboration with the Clique.

He has not seen his wife in months.\n\nHe has begun to entertain the possibility that he might die without seeing her, or she without seeing him, when the doorbell rings. A friend-turned-enemy: Zhang Qun is waiting for him, smile limber and greasy as a pork-knuckle slice hanging from a butcher's shop.\n\nHe has in hand a few papers, gathered in a dossier for easy reference: attached to some of them are pictures, charts and rows of numbers. Reading them, Chiang's hands begin to tremble. It is suddenly hard to focus with the spike that has embedded itself in his chest. The Chiang Family has lost its patriarch. Now, it appears, it might lose everything else.\n\nZhang Qun nods, almost sagacious. He gestures to the charts, speaking of the obvious: unless something is done, the Chiang family is about to lose everything it still has. Then he leans closer, whispering that there is something Chiang can still do to save them. Something he can do for his successor, his old friend. Otherwise...well, even an old friend has limits, does he not?\n\nWhen Chiang reappears, he seems - different, somehow. Witnesses report an almost artificial cheerfulness on the part of the ex-President, and his praise of the Political Science Clique seems almost - forced, as if through bitter tears.

Yet for now the loudest noise was the ruffling of leaves from the trees on the schoolyard outside, the low noise was much merciful compared to the heavy clattering of windows or screams as umbrellas were yanked from hands usually worming its way into his skull as he desperately tried to study for his final exams.\n\nPen scratched ink on paper as the setting sun continuously shrouded the classroom in darkness. Beside him there were only a handful of other students sitting in the creeping twilight, like him they could not afford the luxury of electricity at home. A decade old lamp screeched to life as his pupils, used to the fading twilight, accustomed to it. He wrote on, noise wormed again into his skull as one of the boys noisily ate his lunch’s leftovers, he barely endured. The noise stopped. The sun vanished behind the hills, a pair of heavy steps rang from outside. He tensed, the steps were drowned out by the intensifying wind. Pens scratched on paper once more, then he heard them again this time from inside the building. Windows clattered loudly and they were gone again.\n\nThe the door flew open, outside stood three men in blue uniforms. Ink splattered over the floor as one of the girls dropped her pen, nobody said anything. The boy with the leftover lunch slowly backed away from the door. A nod, two of the men stormed towards the boy. A punch flew, then another. Blood from a broken nose and shattered jaw sprayed onto white paper. They dragged the boy out, the man in the doorstep gave a curt bow and they were alone once more.\n\nShaking he began writing again, ink mixing with blood as the wind carried muffled screams from outside."

Subtlety was truly not Nanjing’s strength. At least they were not torturing them yet with those horrid songs they claimed the Marshal had written themselves, his son had complained endlessly over how the japanese singers on the radio had so much better recording equipment than the chinese ones. Defeated again apparently. All the different types of crap they hurled out still amazed him, posters, flags, portraits, slings and most of all simple consumer goods with the KMT or Chiang logo slapped onto.\n\nYet despite it all, he did like his job. Pay was good, working conditions above average and for once his bosses cared more for the quality of the work than its quantity. For nobody wanted a banner which misspelled the three principles of the people or worse yet a portrait with the President’s face horribly misfigured. And all it had cost him was a little donation to the mayor's office, truly some things never changed.\n\nSo he stood in the factory's courtyard, smoking a cigarette adored with the white on blue sun and the President’s face on its package.

Chiang Kai-Shek, president of the Republic of China paced in his opulent office, a glass of scotch in hand. He shifted his gaze to the portrait hanging behind his desk, Dr Sun Yat-Sen, Father of the Republic and modern China.\n\nHe remembered when he had first gazed upon the White Sun, back in 1908 as his mentor Chen Qinmei had introduced him to Sun’s Tongmenghui society, later he had been one of the Kuomintang’s founding members. Truly one of the few glories his rivals did not try to take from him, he chuckled. Then he marched alone, with both his mentors robbed from him by illness or assassin, he had fought valiantly against all threats to the Republic. Marched on and on against warlords, communists and the Japanese Bandits. And he had won, they had won. He remembered now when he had last gazed longingly upon the portrait. Just after they had won their final triumph over the red menace, after days of celebration in Nanjing's ballrooms and streets, he had found a moment of quiet in Dr Sun’s acrylic eyes.\n\nNow they stood triumphant once more, his rivals dealt with one way or another and the Republic secured. And secure it would be, as in the office of Eternal President, created just for him today, he would rule until his death. The three principles would be fulfilled duly under his watch, Nationalism: China stood strong and proud once more and he would see that it would take its spot among the great powers of the world, one day perhaps even surpassing the United States. Welfare: Nanjing’s bustling streets were only the beginning, for with foreign money and expertise flowing into the country in due time the people of China would enjoy a better living than they ever had before. Democracy: ...the party was secured and surely ready to carry on the torch of the revolution forever. The people were still not ready for self rule, China was still too backwards, still under attack from within and without.

While various governments across Asia have responded with mixed messages towards such a radical foreign policy initiative, one thing now is certain; China is back."

twrchinaforeign.106.d:0 "In the ancient city of Nanjing, several political leaders came together with the Chinese president to discuss the establishment of the Nanjing Pact. The NP would, according to Chinese officials, be a "wall in the face of destructive communism and western imperialism throughout the entire globe". As more and more of the world relegates itself into different factions and alliances, it seems as though the Kuomintang wants to throw in its own hat onto the stage of global politics. Whether or not the pact will succeed in its mission is yet to be seen."

I still wouldn't be able to understand.\" Chiang sat in the chair in front of the desk and rubbed his temple. \"I...\" He sighed, and looked at the ambassador. \"Change your vote.\"\n\nThe ambassador was caught off guard. \"What?\"\n\nChiang responded snappily, saying, \"Vote no. Your job security - and China's future - both depend on it.\"\n\nThe UN Ambassador was still surprised, but he still knew that he had no choice. He did not want to lose his position, especially over a single vote. He knew what to say, and what to do."

While Gan Jiehou's main task was to arrange Li Zongren's schedule during his diplomatic visit, his position has granted him access into the secret underworld of Chinese espionage on American soil. Subsequently, Gan Jiehou has made numerous ties to Americans sympathetic to the Chinese operations.\n\nNow with the political situation in China stabilized, the government must make a decision on Gan Jiehou.
