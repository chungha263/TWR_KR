TUR_opposing_influences:0 "Opposing Influences"
TUR_opposing_influences_desc:0 "As a neutral power at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, Turkey has found herself stuck between two powerful spheres of influence. On one hand is Germany, Turkey's old ally from the First World War who turned to the ways of far-right irredentism. On the other hand is the Toronto Accord, made up of the United States, Britain, Canada, and a few other nations, who seek to bring democracy to Europe, but have a checkered history with Turkey. Shall the Turkish nation turn to her old allies, her fellow members of the United Nations, or remain neutral?"
TUR_heterogeneous_army:0 "Heterogeneous Army"
TUR_heterogeneous_army_desc:0 "With a lack of unifying influences or a strong government, the officials of the Turkish Armed Forces have taken things into their own hands, refusing to cooperate with those who they disagree with. This division among the high command and army officials has caused the strength of our military to sharply decline, and we will need to make great improvements to our political and military standing in order to be recognised as a militarily-competent nation."
TUR_ASALA_presence:0 "ASALA Presence"
TUR_ASALA_presence_desc:0 "The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, or ASALA for short, is a terrorist organisation active within our borders that fights for the integration of Western Armenia into Armenia, as well as for our government to recognise the Armenian Genocide. There are rumours that they are backed by the Armenian government, but these have been denied by both ASALA and the government of Armenia."

TUR_opposing_influences_nazi_desc:0 "The ultimate discord in Turkish politics has been eliminated with an undeniable amount of politicians advocating for racial supremacy and deportation of the minorities as well as voicing their support for the THB. Following the turn of events, the right-wing communion has started a large scale campaign in the hopes of installing their ideals to every mind in every corner of the country."

twrturkey.1.t:0 "Republic Day"
twrturkey.1.d:0 "All throughout the nation today people flock to the streets to celebrate Republic Day, the anniversary of the day Mustafa Kemal Ataturk proclaimed the foundation of the Republic of Turkey after the long and hard-fought War of Independence. While these are trying times for the nation, thousands, if not millions are at least united in mutual respect and admiration for the man who brought his country from ruin and made it into a modern, secular republic for all to enjoy. "
twrturkey.1.a:0 "Someone fetch the flags!"
twrturkey.1.b:0 "Celebrating? In the streets? For him? Fetch the police at once!"

twrturkey.2.t:0 "The Revision of the Izmir Economic Congress"
twrturkey.2.d:0 "WIP"
twrturkey.2.a:0 "The matter will be of upmost importance."

twrturkey.3.t:0 "Operation Vindicator"
twrturkey.3.d:0 "The wolf is is in position, the gun is cocked and there is visual on the target. Should everything go according to plan, the era of the scoundrelous Menderes regime will swiftly come to an end. The only thing we need to start the rising is the order, shall he?"
twrturkey.3.a:0 "Howl the gray wolf shall."


twrturkey.4.t:0 "The Gray Wolf Rising"
twrturkey.4.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the far-right has taken control of Turkey. This morning as prime minister Menderes was fatally shot while leaving his local mosque. The assassin, after being shot dead by Menderes's bodyguards, was found to have been a member of the far-right underground. In the ensuing chaos in the capital, armed militias belonging to the THB stormed into the Grand National Assembly and declared the current parliament to be subsequently dissolved and the appointment of Cevat Rıfat Atilhan as the new prime minister. In a radio address later that day, the new "Genel Önder" Nihal Atsız gave a passionate speech on the new Turkey saying "Operation Vindicator has been an outstanding success, and a new age will finally dawn in the history of the Turkish People." he went on to declare the formation of the Turan Democratic Party as the only legal party in the new Turkey."
twrturkey.4.a:0 "Never would've guessed."

twrturkey.5.t:0 "Cleansing the Army"
twrturkey.5.d:0 "Our absolute hold on the Turkish State must be secured if we are to survive, and there's one major obstacle in our way. There are many prominent officers in the Turkish Land Forces that sympathize with the West and even the old regime, a dangerous threat to the Turanist Party, and if given the opportunity they would undoubtedly attempt to seize control of the state for their own twisted gains. They won't get such an opportunity though. Under the recommendation of the Genel Önder, an extensive shakeup of the Land Forces at every level is imperative to ensure loyalty to the state and its leader. These potentially fifth-columnist generals are now being court-martialled on charges of treason and conspiracy. These measures will very likely cripple the operational capabilities of the army for some time, but ultimately it is a necessary sacrifice to root out any future rebellious influences within the military."
twrturkey.5.a:0 "The remaining opposition will be hunted down!"

twrturkey.6.t:0 "The Menace Within"
twrturkey.6.d:0 "For decades, the Turkish people have been held back from their desire to seize their rightful destiny in the world. The reason for this, in the Prime Minister's words, is "The subversive Jewish bloodsuckers and Armenian parasites that are corrupting the Turkish people". He is clearly not the only one within the party that shares this belief, as the Grand National Assembly today unanimously passed new legislation to answer the "Question Of Subversive Minorities". All Turkish citizens, residents and immigrants of Jewish or Armenian heritage are to be stripped of their citizenship and assets. They will then be given 24 hours to leave Turkey in perpetuity. Those in defiance of the expulsion order will be charged with sedition and will be dealt with by the state accordingly. With this new act, there is no doubt that the Turkish people now stand unopposed internally."
twrturkey.6.a:0 "Turkey belongs to the Turks!"

twrturkey.7.t:0 "Turkish Claims On the Island"
twrturkey.7.d:0 "Following "The Gray Wolf Rising", Turkish authorities are pushing their resources to take the lands designated as theirs in the National Oath. Cyprus, being one of them, we have been asked to cede the island to the Turks".
twrturkey.7.a:0 "Are they out of their mind?"
twrturkey.7.b:0 "Let's choose the safe alternative."

twrturkey.8.t:0 "The British Agree"
twrturkey.8.d:0 "The United Kingdom has agreed to
twrturkey.8.a:0 "They weren't so stupid after all."

twrturkey.9.t:0 "Mass Deportation in Turkey"
twrturkey.9.d:0 "Disturbing reports from Ankara came in today, as Genel Önder Atsız signed off legislation dealing with what is being called "The Question Of Subversive Minorities". What international observers are calling state-sanctioned deportation on par with the German Reich, Turkish citizens of Jewish or Armenian ancestry are to be stripped of their citizenship and given a day to leave the country. As many Jewish-run shops have been closing shop up for good, Grey Wolf paramilitaries have been spotted in every major city harassing the former business owners and many Armenian residents have been reportedly getting into fistfights with police over the eviction notices. Later in the evening, synagogues as well as Jewish and Armenian properties were vandalized and their contents inside looted before being torched to the ground by Turanist supporters. The connection between these acts of violence and the state is indistinguishable, as the local police were nowhere to be found that night, and Grey Wolf officers riling the crowd up with inflammatory slogans encouraging what they call the "Night Of Turkic Reclamation"." 
twrturkey.9.a:0 "It's like a Turkish Kristallnacht..."
