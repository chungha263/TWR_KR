#Leaders
Rallis_Desc:0 "Distinguished politician and lawyer, Ioannis Rallis rose to rank of President of the Hellenic State after the forced resignation of Konstantinos Logothetopoulos by the Germans due to the Deutsche-Mark Crisis. Father of the Security Battalions and head of the Unionist faction, Rallis is despised by the people but adored by the Italians and Germans as a loyal and orderly puppet. With plans of reformation of the regime, Rallis aims primarily towards the establishment of order in the nation through a peaceful transition to a more liberated Greece with the "approval" of its overlords."
BOURANTAS_DESC:0 "Bourantas is a monster of a man, even by the standards of his monstrous compatriots. After putting in years of service as an officer of the collaborator government, Bourantas rose to prominence when he became commander of the dreaded Security Battalions. The upper echelons of the Hellenic state administration  regarded him with appropriate fear and trepidation from the very beginning. Despite (or perhaps because of) his and his men's well-deserved reputation for brutality towards partisans and civilians alike, the Hellenic state's leaders felt there were uses for a man of Bourantas' character. The more "respectable" fascists he answered to believed they could channel his disastrous wrath for their own purposes. \n\nIn retrospect, it was naive to think that the worst of Bourantas' excesses could be reigned in like he was a human attack dog. It was only a matter of time until they turned their bayonets on their former superiors. When Bourantas announced to his men that the time had come to "cleanse" Greece, they moved quickly without a hint of remorse or hesitation. The Italo-fascists came to know the same trademark brutality that the common folk of Greece had been well-acquainted with for years. With Bourantas and his Verbands in full control of the government, the few restraints that were placed on them are gone. Nothing is off-limits anymore now that the dogs of war are running wild."
LOGOTHETOPOULOS_DESC:0 "At one time in his life, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos was a respected medical practitioner and professor of gynecology. In the 1920's he instructed hundreds of medical students in this art at the University of Athens, where he eventually became the school dean. Just as the Axis invasion was a great shock that took Greece by surprise, his fall from grace couldn't have been more unexpected for those who knew him as a mild-mannered doctor. \n\nHis brief tenure as prime minister of the collaborator government from 1942 and 1943 demolished any respect or fondness anyone had ever had for him. As the German and Italian forces committed one atrocity after another, Logothetopoulos' indifference towards his countrymen's suffering marked him as an obsequious pawn to foreign interests. Although he made token objections to German overreach in Greek politics, he was by and large a passive figure until he was removed from power altogether in April of 1943. \n\nAgainst all odds, Logothetopoulos has wormed his way back into power following Ioannis Rallis' death. Now heading the Italophilic Hellenic Fascist Front (HFF), Logothetopoulos' convictions remain unchanged by the passage of time. His loyalties now lie with Rome rather than Germania, but his role as a facilitator of imperial exploitation is the same as it ever was. His present station in life is not an enviable one. Although the general populace regards him as a loathsome traitor, he is committed to ensuring that nothing interferes with Italy hollowing out Greece's natural resources."
GIOSMAS_DESC:0 "As his honorific knighthood would suggest, Xenofon von Giosmas could be said to be an enthusiast for all things German. At one time in his life he was a bog-standard fascist, but his long-standing admiration for the Nazi reich has caused his views to become progressively more extreme. As the leader of the Hellenic Nationalist Socialist Front (HNSF), his movement has adopted a syncretic ideology he refers to in state media broadcasts as "Merkourism". Taking inspiration from the writings of Otto Strasser, von Giosmas advocates for vigorous militarism, the foundation of national worker's guilds, a focus on agrarianism, and a renewal of traditional morality. \n\nAs von Giosmas illustrated in his victory speech, he feels that the regeneration of past Greek glory can only be achieved through a blood sacrifice on an unprecedented scale. Greece as a nation cannot be complete until all rightfully Greek territory is reclaimed from the Slavic and Turkish untermensch. In all these endeavors, von Giosmas comfortably enjoys the backing of the Reich home office. While some of the more conservative figures in Germania are wary of Giosmas' radicalism, they recognize his loyalty to the Reich as an invaluable asset to German interests."
Angelos_Evert_DESC:0 "Angelos Evert has dutifully served as the chief commissioner of the Athens city police for the better part of a decade. The son of Bavarian expatriates who moved to Greece during the reign of Otto I, Evert is viewed by his peers as a quiet and unassuming bureaucrat. His placid demeanor belies an unseen craftiness. Despite his public image as a dutiful servant of the Axis powers, Evert hasn't exactly disguised his casual disinterest in fascism or his nostalgia for the deposed Greek monarchy. Other high-ranking law enforcement officers have (correctly) suspected that his loyalties lie elsewhere based on the fact that his department has reported an anomalously low number of Jews to the Gestapo over the years. He'd never say it out loud, but Evert has spent years illicitly falsifying passports for Athens' Jewish population to protect them from the Gestapo.\n\nMore than anything else, Evert's quarrels lie with the communists rather than the Jews. He's a strong believer in the cult of tradition. He believes that the old collaborator government forsook Greece's noble past for the sake of ingratiating itself to Rome and Germania. Evert hopes to restore some semblance of decency and decorum to Greek politics by reinstating the monarchy. After seeing the consequences of right and left-wing radicalism run amok (namely with the bloody excesses of the security battalions and their dastardly Bolshevik opponents), he feels that a return to the tried and true traditions of the past is exactly what the country needs. Now that Greece has distanced itself somewhat from Germania, Evert has just the opportunity he needs to invite king Paul back to reclaim his throne."
Panos_Katsareas_DESC:0 "Although first lieutenant Panos Katsareas had briefly fought in the resistance before defecting to join the dreaded security battalions, his commanding officers overlooked this unfortunate detail because they had uses for his skills. Following Germany's victory over the allied forces, Katsareas founded the National Anti-Communist Groups of Hunters (EAOK). As a subordinate organization of the SB's, the EAOK's line of work for the last decade has been to root out and crush communist dissent wherever it exists.\n\nFollowing a failed attempt on his life by communist partisans in 1945, Katsareas orchestrated what is now referred to in hushed tones across the South Peloponnese as the "white terror." Men under his command swarmed the countryside putting suspected communists to the sword by the hundreds. Mass hangings of farmers accused of aiding partisans became a fixture of the terror in the popular memory. Despite his well-documented preference for monarchism over fascism, Katsareas has shown time and time again that he has no mercy for communists (or anyone he claims are communists). He seeks above all other things to restore the deposed Greek monarchy in the hopes of putting an end to the deviancy of the communists."
Takis_Makedonas_DESC:0 "Sergeant Major Takis Makedonas has long been regarded with wariness by his fellow security officers. Anyone who's served under him for any length of time can attest to his ego and his violent temper being fixtures of their interactions with him. It's rumoured among some of his compatriots that he'd unsuccessfully attempted to join the Greek resistance as a commissioned officer before he founded the anti-communist EASAD, but no one who values their life would ever dare say it out loud in mixed company.\n\nIt's always been known that Makedonas is a strange, brutal man who's obsessed with his own vanity before all other things. It's hard to say what exactly goes on his head, but what's known for certain is that the Axis occupation has intensified his worst tendencies. He was never a stable person to begin with, but the long years of embittered, inconclusive sparring with the partisans have encouraged him to act on his darker urges. His mounting frustration over his inability to crush the rebels for good has fueled the complexification of his delusions of grandeur. The desire for unrestrained power gesticulates in him like a malignant black root, succoured by the blood of innocents.\n\nThere are no more barriers to his deepest desires now that he holds total dominion over the entire country. No bridge is too far in Makedonas' demented quest for greatness. He will stop at nothing to see his name printed in the history books as the greatest leader Greece has ever known."
Grigoris_Sourlas_DESC:0 "It's not certain how, when, or where "captain" Grigoris Sourlas of the EASAD acquired his captaincy. Who it was in the collaborationist military that bestowed the rank upon him isn't known to anyone but Sourlas himself, if such a person even exists. When it comes to the nicknames the captain has acquired during his time with the security battalions, things are decidedly less ambiguous. "The bloody bandit", "the varangian," "the dire wolf," and "the land waster" are just a handful of the titles bestowed on him over the years, with the "the hangman of Demerli" being one of the oldest and most enduring. The captain first attracted such moniker in the killing fields of Thessaly, where he garnered a reputation as a man of unparalleled ruthlessness and depravity.\n\nDespite officially being a servant of the Hellenic state, Sourlas has spent the better part of the last decade plundering Thessaly as a bandit and warlord. Large parts of the region are de facto lawless, with men under his command routinely burning down farmsteads suspected of harboring partisans, press-ganging hapless civilians into joining his gang, and coercing villages into paying tribute to him. Sourlas' voracious sexual appetite is infamous among his nominal superiors in the security battalions. Stories of him dragging women and girls into barns during farm raids are a common fixture in any discussion concerning him.\n\nAs the newly-instated head of the security battalions and the Hellenic state, Sourlas intends to apply his methods to the entirety of Greece. Now that marshall Bourantas is out of the picture, Sourlas answers to no one but himself. He will start a fire to burn down the whole country if that's what it takes to eradicate Bolshevism from Greece for good."

Faced by three groups, the collaborator government has to pick and choose its allies and its enemies.\n\nThe §OBarbarian Frontists§! led by §OBourantas§! and his remnants of unwilful officers of the Security Battalions and Verbands. Fueled by greed, nationalist anarchism, bloodlust and much more grim aspects of humanity, the Bourantas and his lackeys work within the extremist elements leftover from the SS occupation services from the 40s, with the goal of turning Greece into their own personal playground.\n\nThe §CRepublican Putsch Brigade§! led by §CGizikis§! and the younger generations of Security Battalions and undercover Republicans. Staunch oppositionists to the collaborators and the Verbands, Gizikis and his soldiers are wish to bring an end to the collaborators and their puppets, to bring back Democracy to Greece even if that means spilling blood in the way.\n\nThe §RGang of the 21st of April§! led by §RPapadopoulos§! and the high ranked officers of the Security Battalions. Ignorant to the collaborationists and caring more about their own personal profit, the Gang of the 21st of April looks out only for its own benefit, trying to work its way around to power through both politics but also pure steel."

Supporters of more Nazi-esque policies along with the modified ideas of Strasserism and Neo-Folkism, the HNSF primarily stands to represent the more niche figures of politics such as Germanophiles, Ultra-Nationalists and the Verband Section of the Security Battalions.

We want an economy which will be nationalized by any means possible and after that we want to have everyone working in a guild-class system which will bring us economic rebirth we always wanted! "
GRE_End_the_Reign_of_the_Landowners:0 "End the Reign of the Landowners"
GRE_End_the_Reign_of_the_Landowners_desc:0 "What is a landowner but a slave owner of the working class who is a pure example of capitalism in our territory? With that in mind, we realized that it was finally time to put an end to the unjust and ruthless struggle between the peasants who do not even have the necessities of life and the landowners who get rich at their expense, building towers and castles on the water! The time has come when, by grace or force, we will prevail in the struggle over Judeo-Bolshevism and capitalism, which has cast a shadow over our economy, always dragging it into the abyss. The land they held will no longer be theirs!"

GRE_Modernise_the_Farmers_desc:0 "Oxen and ordinary hoes cannot cultivate the land as fast as the peasants need to survive the hungry years that always lurk around one corner or the other, sometimes lurking from both corners at the same time. With investments from the state budget, we will direct farmers towards more modern equipment that will bring them significant relief in land cultivation, and at the same time bring a higher profit that they desperately need."
GRE_Establish_the_Hellenic_Agrarian_Guild:0 "Establish the Hellenic Agrarian Guild"
GRE_Establish_the_Hellenic_Agrarian_Guild_desc:0 "In order to break the shackles of the dictatorial economy imposed by Hitler during the 1930s, we must take responsibility for breaking the state system introduced during the occupation and have the right to decide how our economy will be run independently. The first step we have to take is the famous breaking of the connection between Hitler's view of solving the problem of Judeo-Bolshevism and capitalism in order to later make the transition to the guild system. After that, we plan to redirect these guilds to the needs of the peasants, and that the peasants will be able to do on their own everything that the decadent Hitlerist view has taken away from them. By doing so, we will help the economy, which will be able to develop in an unhindered direction."

GRE_Extra_Work_for_the_Non_Hellenes_desc:0 "In order to be able to ensure the common good of all the Hellenes in our state, we will have to introduce a new organizational plan within our industry. This plan will have in mind the reduction of working hours for all Hellens, while each non-Helen will have additional hours in all shifts. Thus, we will achieve the basic goal of our idea, and that is the cleansing of all our spaces from the influence of Judeo-Bolshevism and capitalism in our state."

GRE_Fund_the_Tobacco_and_Cotton_Guilds_desc:0 "With the establishment of the basic foundations for the development of guilds in Greece, we have begun a fateful step towards the revival of our economy, but the road is yet to be traversed to the goal. Now we have to break the agrarian section into smaller parts so that we can divide them according to the needs for production - tobacco and cotton are of greater importance to us for now, until we manage to ensure a significant profit in the economy."
GRE_Steel_and_Land:0 "Steel and Land"
GRE_Steel_and_Land_desc:0 "We live from food that is grown on farms and we live from an industry that further processes it so it allows us to enjoy more luxurious goods as well.

But it will take a long time to show the real results we need, but with these ideas we can go far."

Papadopoulos claims that he devised a system of further torture of prisoners who were declared conspirators, claiming that torture would mentally and mentally break them to speak out. If his words are to be believed, this will give us further insight into the situation regarding the problems of communism and the Security Battalions that are bandits.

It seems like a very unattractive offer because we must never trust an Italian, but desperate times have pushed us into their economic arms.

The private sector survived a catastrophic blow to the stomach at the beginning of the invasion, and after the Italians took control of almost all branches of the Greek economy, everything improved. But their power has weakened and we must not risk the collapse of the industry again, even though the occupiers are in question.

There is an enviable amount of petroleum in the seas that we could use for plants, but that will mean that we will have to destroy all the natural beauties of our shores because of that. But the goal does not choose the means, Machiavelli once said, so we will start with the realization of these projects.

In order to succeed in that plan, we will invite Italian military experts to Athens, where they will settle, at least temporarily, until we reopen Evelpidon.

After the Academy was disbanded under the influence of the Italians who did not want to have a strong Greece, we lost a lot of talented personnel of officers who fought gloriously against the Italians until the Reich came as an intervention.

For almost five centuries we were under foreign occupation and we knew how to play a puppet better than the puppets themselves, and using the right moment, we freed ourselves.

twrGreeceRework.1.d:0 "The smell is suffocating. Black smoke coming from burning piles of corpses is blocking the sun. The devastation is complete and the whole village annihilated. Even the most hardened and cold-hearted of inspectors seeing the mayhem cried. \n\nWe know that only a certain band of rogue soldiers, led by the "Dragon of Thessalonika" as he is called by fearful peasants from Peloponnese to Thrace, could commit such an act of savagery. Nobody knows for sure who these people are, but what is for sure is that everybody is fearing them. \n\nAccording to the public, this kind of gruesome deed should not be left unpunished. We got, however, one "but" in this. The Verband of the Dragon works under us, as we are servants of the Italian government. Our overlords surely think that fear will keep our people in check, and would react negatively if we give to these thugs what they deserve. If we let these pillagers continue their lives without any kind of repercussions, backlash from the public will be severe."
twrGreeceRework.1.a:0 "Crimes like these aren't going to be left unpunished."

twrGreeceRework.2.t:0 "The Dragon of Thessalonika Escapes"
twrGreeceRework.2.d:0 "After retaliating against the actions of the so-called Dragon of Thessalonica by sending the Security Battalions to capture him and eliminate the threat he poses to public order, the government now faces a new crisis as the effort failed, with the Dragon only being injured rather than killed, and managing to escape north, to sanctuary provided by allies in Bulgaria. Even as the threat he posed fades without disappearing entirely, the Security Battalions themselves are upset with the government, as the Dragon was an associate of theirs and held in high regard by them. Some rumors say that they are preparing to resist should the government try and have their leaders share the Dragon's intended fate. As tensions rise between the Security Battalions and the government they are supposedly under the authority of, and the mutual trust between the two rapidly evaporates, most of the rest of the Greek people watch with caution, now increasingly thinking that the situation isn't just becoming worse."

twrGreeceRework.201.t:0 "The Security Battalions Demand Justice!"
twrGreeceRework.201.d:0 "Today, the Security Battalions have put out a public statement demanding that action is taken by the government against those politicians who directed the attack on the Dragon of Thessalonica, as a form of justice for their associate. Although the government is obviously reluctant to allow the arrest and imprisonment of such prominent figures in it, or to give into the demands so easily and lose face, when taking the mutinous mood present throughout much of the Security Battalions and the delicate nature of the situation into consideration, some fear that punishing them for making the demands to make an example out of them could cause the current tensions to explode into a conflict with disastrous consequences for the general public. With a difficult choice before them, the final decision of the government is still unclear, and the Greek people wait cautiously to see who will come out on top in the infighting between the security services and political leaders of the collaborationist state."

Having backed them so publicly, it seems the Battalions have only been emboldened. \n\nMany who were not recently purged have expressed their concern with these brutes. However effective they have proven in fending off dissidents within the country, it is becoming increasingly clear that the role as our brutal enforcers will not satisfy the Security Battalions for long. \n\nFor now, they have been granted further authority within the state and while there are some truly concerning reports regarding their conflicts with dissidents and some displeased civilians, they have ultimately staved off the communists and the republicans. \n\nFor now, we must stick by our decision but keep an eye on them. If given any more power, they may see the existence of an authority above them as unnecessary."

twrGreeceRework.203.t:0 "The Poulos Verband Threat"
twrGreeceRework.203.d:0 "Our choice to support the Security Battalions has proven to be a controversial one to say the least. These brutes have only escalated their brutal tactics since we backed them and it is clearly putting a strain on our hold of the nation. \n\nRecently, there has been an...incident that we simply cannot cover up. The Poulos Verband, headed by Georgios Poulos, has been a rather infamous group, frequently cited whenever several dozen civilians end up dead without explanation. In recent days however, they have quite frankly outdone themselves. Where normally such atrocities were committed with some level of secrecy so that they could be swept under the rug, Georgios and his goons have gone on an unashamed rampage throughout the greek countryside. \n\nSuch blatant brutality cannot go unanswered, even with the Security Battalions' newly granted authority. We have two options to help quell the public unrest. With each day these disturbing reports go unanswered, the more citizens we lose to the partisans' cause. \n\nWe can either publicly denounce the Poulos Verband and their rampage, crafting a statement that condemns the recent uptick in pillaging. Ultimately, the Battalions likely won't care about what is said about them and we cannot offer much punishment beyond that without inciting civil war. However, this might stem the increase in the populace turning to the partisans. \n\nThe alternative is a bit more...extreme and were the Security Battalions not becoming such an issue, it wouldn't be considered. We could secretly inform the EAM-ELLAS of the current location of the Poulos Verband and let them handle the execution of justice. The idea might just bring the rest of the Battalions in line if they're rage is more focused on the partisans however killing off our own enforcers and not even by our own hands will only weaken our tenuous hold on power. \n\nRegardless, a decision must be made soon, else we sacrifice the initiative to another faction."

twrGreeceRework.204.d:0 "With our public condemnation of the Poulos Verband's rampage and the subsequent condemnation of the Security Battalions' recent increase in brutality, we have angered our enforcers. What to us seemed like the lightest treatment to appease the populace was taken as a blatant insult to everything the Battalions apparently stood for. \n\nTheir response is concerning. Where before the Battalions heeded our instructions, simply interpreting them in a troubling way, now they blatantly ignore us and rampage of their own accord. Our repeated attempts to rein them in have been met with further ignorance and even a few threats. The situation has quickly gone from concerning to critical. Our toughest enforcers aren't answering us and while they are seeking partisans on their own, they are spending far too much time pillaging the people. \n\nThe...intensity of this pillaging is also another concern. We tolerated looting, a few fires and a few women missing but now it seems the Battalions are taking out their frustrations on our people. Wholesale slaughter is reported in some areas and in others, all that remains of some villages is ash and debris. Any survivors are sure to join our opposition and the Battalions are likely to become a new faction of opposition at this rate. \n\nWe have sacrificed too much power to the Battalions to effectively counteract their pillaging. Their numbers, while comparable to our own, would leave us exposed to the partisans if we were to go after them. As it stands, we can only watch on in horror as these animals tear our country apart."

twrGreeceRework.205.d:0 "The day we have been fearing for months has finally come. The Security Battalions, in their restlessness under our rule have decided to do away with our authority over them. We have been given plenty of warning by the garrisons here in Athens, the brutes are storming the very capital of this nation and making it look like childsplay. Their Leader, Nikolas Bourantas, has made a public announcement as his troops pillage their way to our doors: 'The Security Battalions are the true will of Hellas. We will build a truly Hellenic nation and we will trample upon the traitors in charge to create it.' Our troops are scattered across Greece, next to none able to respond to the battle mere streets away. Greek citizens are fleeing in droves, some mowed down by Security forces for sport, others finding their way out or into the Presidential Mansion. We are harbouring the refugees of our own failure and with every moment wasted more of our people are put to slaughter. We must put an end to this. \n\nThe government has two key options. We surrender to the Battalions and allow Nikolaos Bourantas to assume the authority of government. Doing so possibly saves thousands of citizens and just maybe ourselves. Or, we could fight. For once, we could hold our ground against these beasts, these animals and assert the true will of Greece. If our garrison knows nothing else, they know the streets of Athens. They could outflank, lead astray and counter these beasts and wear them down. However, even if we were to come out victorious, the country would almost certainly fall into civil war. Once word gets out that our government will no longer tolerate the Battalions' blatant exploitation of the citizenry, they will come down on us with a vengeance that is hard to imagine."

twrGreeceRework.206.d:0 "The pencil-pushers we carved our way towards met us with a white flag. Pathetic. At the very least, the boys were looking forward to some worthwhile fighting at the Presidential building. Regardless, the Italian puppets have given us what we wanted on a silver platter: Freedom. Freedom to take what we want when we want, Freedom to expand the influence of these glorious, Hellenic Battalions that will cleanse 'Greece' and remake it into a nation for the Hellenic master race! \n\nBourantas got the younger kids to drag out what remained of that overstretched government in front of him. A few gunshots were heard inside but...well, no one'll miss some Italian collaborators. Still, the recruits got the important ones out, on their knees and rambling on about 'Deal' this and ‘Effective government' that. We were all lined up and ready for Nikolas' next order. The damn fools were begging for something or other. Protection for the people, something, anything. It was...maddening. If there's one thing a Security Battalion Rifleman hates, it's weaklings pretending they're in charge, especially the non-Hellenic kind. Finally, we wouldn't have to be dealing with any of it anymore. Finally, no one would be around to tell us to stop. Finally, there'd be nothing but us to lead the land. Finally, the Hellen people could remake their nation as the Germans up north had. Bourantas raised an arm, a squad trained their guns on them. There was begging, there was screaming but once that raised arm fell, the Reorganised Hellenic State was born."

twrGreeceRework.207.d:0 "The decision had been made. These brutes cannot be entrusted with the future of the Greek people. The bickering remains of the government quickly went about giving orders. Some found a place for the refugees, others gave direction to fearful troops. The situation was desperate and no one was under any illusion that the chance of survival wasn't slim to none. \n\nWe're lucky the captains and sergeants didn't abandon us. The renewed vigor from us surged in them and what was a desperate delaying action turned into quite the game of cat and mouse. Little by little, squads of Security Battalion troops were led astray by our forces, their bloodlust serving perfectly in leading them into trap after trap. One particular report garnered interest though in the heat of battle, it might have simply been a rumour to boost morale. One of the younger troops baited an entire squad of these animals away from a tank as the rest of his squad dealt with it with Anti-Tank grenades. When the young man was found later, he was dead, peppered with an unnecessary amount of rounds but surrounded by three corpses. That vigor was everywhere in Athens...well, what remains of it. We don't know what the next days in this warzone will bring but with Battalion forces intensifying the brutality, we hope at the very least that word gets out that we chose war not surrender."

twrGreeceRework.208.d:0 "In the days following the battle in Athens between Bourantas and the existing government, the Security Battalions have gone rogue. As expected, such a strong refusal to kneel before the Darwinian morals of the Battalions has left them with only one choice if they are to assume control: Rebellion. Under a varying assortment of flags and symbols, the Battalions have spread out and seized various swaths of Greek territory in the name of the Bourantas government. Their thuggish tactics, along with their record for pillaging their own nation has left them with little to no public support. However, when these Battalions need only appeal to man's most basic impulses for recruits and can steal the rest, the support of the people is no longer needed. \n\nScattered skirmishes and battles across Greece have resulted in a mix of territories falling into Battalion hands. They currently hold the regions of Epirus, Central Macedonia and Southern Peloponnese. Meanwhile, the government of the Greek State has used remaining loyalist forces to maintain control over the remainder of Greece. Despite the dire turn of events, the Greek State's resolve has been renewed after rebelling Battalion forces in Athens. Their position is desperate, especially considering how poorly they've allowed the country to fall but with no other option, the partisans long gone, many are rallying to the State to fend off the Battalions."

twrGreeceRework.210.d:0 "This will prove a controversial move. Relying on the very partisans fighting against us to rid ourselves of a greater threat. However, the greater threat was indeed the Poulos Verband and the Battalions. Their constant streak of blatant pillaging of our nation could not go unpunished. If they were left unchecked those barbarians could have gained significant influence. \n\nThe report came in recently, an extremely detailed recount of the EAM's ambush of the Poulos Verband. It seems our tip has at least earned us this much. The Verband was completely destroyed after being tracked down and ambushed at camp. Effective shock troops they were but they lacked the discipline to keep decent watch after a 'Good hunt'. The EAM decimated everyone in their way but saved the best for last. Poulos and his lieutenants were lined up and executed one by one, the man himself coming last. The author of the note goes into an unhealthy amount of detail about the man's dread and fear, him and his lieutenants begging for their lives right up until the end. Whether the partisans are trying to intimidate us or simply make an example of the Verband, it matters not. The issue has been dealt with. \n\nThere are however, further reports of the ambush being used as political propaganda to boost EAM-ELLAS popularity.

Our counter-media, preaching duty to Greece and its people is ringing hollow in many ears across the nation. Stretched as we are, we can offer little in the way of policing actions in response to the growing Communist influence across our lands. That lack of consistent crackdown, on striking workers, on communist flags and slogans being thrown about, on the red tide slowly consuming the populace has only emboldened the EAM-ELLAS. To use further force to set an example would only incite civil war now. \n\nRumours of a coup have grown in Athens with each passing day. The unease in the city is palpable. Here, more than anywhere else, we of the party have grown to become weary of the worker. For the man who fixes our stove may yet be the one to turn on us. Such distrust in the very men and women working under us could only lead to an inciting incident. \n\nToday, that incident has occurred. This morning a party official, paranoia having built for weeks, shot a man dead on the street when he heard an EAM-ELLAS slogan slip from his mouth. It has merely been hours since and the streets of Athens have been thrown into chaos. Old Republican flags are being flown alongside the flag of the Soviet Union and standard red banners. Large-scale protests are sprouting up all over the city, the people declaring several ‘Liberated Zones' our forces cannot get to without causing a massacre. \n\nRealistically, we have two options. We step down and allow our people to decide the fate of Greece. Doing so may just spare our lives. The protests have yet to turn violent although that could change at any moment. Alternatively, just outside of Athens, we have kept a Security Battalion close by for an occasion like this. With their reduced influence, they have been serving as good dogs to sick on partisans.

Much of our time is spent cleaning up after their messes, be it removing evidence of their looting or paying off particularly affected citizens to keep them quiet. Among these Battalions, one has proven to have both a significant reputation and a ceaseless hunger for causing chaos: The Poulos Verband. While other battalions will at least make half an effort to keep their 'thorough security procedures' a secret, Georgios Poulos and his henchmen have been causing more and more trouble. \n\nThis man alone is causing instability within Greece that we cannot tolerate. Our administration is fragile, it has been since it's inception but if Georgios isn't stopped, this unrest could spiral out of control. Already, the people are massing at police stations and Security Battalion headquarters across the nation to protest our Poulos and the general brutality we perform to keep this nation intact. People like Georgios will not listen to reason. He has been contacted numerous times about his conduct and has blown off every message, too consumed with his crusade against partisans and the pillaging he does along the way. He must die. \n\nOur loyalist forces could be sent to deal with him. However, with the factionism in Greece, between the Partisans, the Battalions and ourselves, our armed forces have suffered. The discipline and vigor our men displayed in our war against Italy is rare to find in the men fighting for us today. Still, it is the obvious choice and if done discreetly, Poulos can be dealt with without the need to anger the Battalions. Alternatively, we could contact the EAM-ELLAS partisans.

With violent terms, he promised to the parliament that Hellas will be ruled under the iron fist of the true patriots against all forms of domestic and foreign degeneracy. In a tirade of pure hatred and passion, von Giosmas warned all the enemies of the state but also the occupiers of Greek land that their end will come when the Red Labrys decapitates all the heads of the "Judeo-Bolshevik and Degenerate Fascist Hydra". \n\nWith the end of his speech, brawls begun within the parliament between members of both parties, along with multiple gunshots being heard.

As an emergency meeting was called at the parliament, Von Giosmas Secretary of Affairs, Markos Merkezinis addressed the parliament in a panicked manner. Reading from a collection of old papers and notes, he declared himself as the successor of Von Giosmas. Showing an unfinished paper by Von Giosmas on the naming of his successor, the parliament entered a state of confusion, uncertain whether to accept Merkezinis as their new President. \n\nIn a very short speech, Merkezinis promised to continue the traditionalist focused social policy of Von Giosmas but focused instead on the light industrialisation and modernisation of the state. While unpopular, he promised that the industrialisation was only to empower the Hellenic State and bring it one step closer to being among the ranks of the great European powers."

"I think we will now be able to clean up the house that was created because of them." The president said after the end of this action. By clearing the bodies from the Presidency and throwing them either in local ditches or in a landfill, the President could address the people that "the rule of Bourantas' animals will finally be brought to justice or to the face of the earth, depending on how they ended and that Greece finally emerges from the chaos of urban unrest."

The shooting soon escalated into a government massacre as all members of the EEK government fell victim to Bourantas' trap in the meeting office, when Bouranats fired three shots at the president and one bullet to the head that killed the army minister. After that, they soon occupied other parts of the building, establishing their position, which was now even stronger after this action. "Tell the police that the EEK tried the coup. And that we must now deal with this rebellion as strongly and as resolutely as we can."

While officially, the occupation is over, the Italian jackboot is felt everywhere: In the commands of "advisors" slavishly followed by collaborationist politicians, and in the strangled economy, held down by subordination to Rome.\n\nThe recent fall of the Logothetopoulos cabinet, consequence of its inability to stabilize the political situation, convinced Greece's overlords that a new, more conciliatory approach was needed. The result was to name Ioannis Rallis as the new prime minister. While Rallis is unmistakably a collaborator, and by extension, universally hated, he and his "Unionist" clique in the ruling oligarchy have expressed their intention to undertake reforms of a magnitude sufficient so as to reconcile the common people with the government.\n\nRallis's rhetoric has raised cautious hope that he might steer Greece back into something resembling normalcy. These optimistic expectations are to be found primarily expressed by the Italian officials who have grown increasingly tired of having to put down partisan uprisings on a regular basis. Ironically, the inflexibility of these same men could very well be the cause of Rallis's downfall, should they not permit the collaborationist government enough freedom to carry out its promised reforms.\n\nAmongst those who saw the appointment of Rallis as a primarily negative development, the growing resistance movement is the most important. Having long banked on the incompetence of successive italian-appointed cabinets to gain strength, a successful premiership could well spell the end of their ambitions to liberate Greece. If, on the contrary, Rallis were to fail and the colaborationist's credibility fully exhausted, only Italy's determination to hold on to the Peloponnese could stop the partisans from taking power."

From the raised platform before the parliament building Rallis speaks passionately about the Greek way of life and, whilst still stressing support for their "allies and benefactors" in the Axis, speaks of a return to the time before the war. \n\nAs he continues to extoll the "Hellenic virtues" of their resilient nation a light murmur of approval is heard from the crowd and Rallis seizes the initiative to capture their hearts. Passion tints his words as he raises his hands to thank the people for their courage in these trying times and to assure them that it is only by their indomitable spirit that Greece marches on. And furthermore- \n\nThere is a shout behind him. He turns to the sound of a clamber on the platform. Rallis' eyes barely register the man's Evzone guard uniform before he feels the cold steel of a bayonet in his gut. Pain blooms and his old legs buckle. The President desperately tries to cling to the podium, still half turned towards the audience. \n\nMore pain. Another stab. Gunshots. A shout. The last thing President Ioannis Rallis sees is a panicked crowd dispersing as the assassin lies dead next to him. When did he fall on the floor? He wonders that as his dream of a peaceful future for Greece bleeds from him, staining the pristine stonework below."

Though many seem content to simply wither away, a few seem passionate enough to fight against this creeping stagnant rot, and factional lines are beginning to emerge around potential policies. \n\nThe Hellenic Fascist Front, aligning itself with the ideals of Mussolini and Petain, seek to modernise their politics. They aim to energise the younger generation with ideals of a modern and futurist fascism to inspire youth to take up arms not just in the army but in the civil service. Opposition sees this as horrifically out of touch with the reality of younger generations. \n\nMeanwhile the Hellenic National Socialist Faction suggests a sort of conscription to solve the issue. Eligible family members of current politicians will be granted immediate party membership and all the responsibilities that entails. This idea has received backlash for potentially breeding political dynasties, nepotism and a dispassionate political class. \n\nThough many within Parliament oppose both factional lines there seems little room for compromise. Whatever moderate groupings the late President Rallis had formed seem to have dissolved with his death. \n\nAs the debate peaks and the votes begin to tally a tie seems inevitable.

Many among our ranks seem to think that the state's dire straits excuse them to simply feed on what's left, lining their pockets with funds and resources our state is in dire need of. If we are to have any hope of salvaging this crumbling state, we must address these leeches. Two plans have been put forward by the Hellenic Fascist Front (EFM) and the Hellenic National Socialist Front (EESM). \n\nThe EFM has come forward with a moderate plan. They propose we remove known corrupt officials on the lower-end of state authority. This way, we can send a message to others that their behaviour is being prosecuted and that will discourage corruption throughout the state. This limited approach will ensure that while we endeavour to eliminate corruption, we won't 'rock the boat' as it were and cause any instability in day to day affairs. We are already in a precarious position to say the least, large-scale change could lead to civil war if we're not careful. The EESM have criticised this plan for being weak and ineffective. Such minimal action could only serve to make corruption less overt and obvious. \n\nThe EESM in contrast has come up with a far more radical plan. Put simply, they want to wipe the slate clean. A fully-fledged purge of anyone even suspected of corruption. While this may cause short-term damage to the state, the EESM has emphasized the long-term gain of a loyal state apparatus. That and the display of power will ensure that those who do survive will not dare act similarly, else they suffer the same fate. The EFM has vehemently decried the 'barbarity' of this policy,claiming it will plunge Greece into chaos."

twrGreeceRework.31.d:0 "Following the Balkan Wars in 1913, we gained the regions of Kavala and (part of) Thrace, inhabited by many ethnic groups. In World War 1, the Greek state took all of Thrace, seizing Eastern Thrace from Bulgaria. When we were invaded in 1940, however, Thrace was annexed by Bulgaria, reversing the gains our men had died for. Since then, Thracian Greeks - the majority of the population - have become second-class citizens in what was once their own land. The Bulgarian minority, as well as migrants from Bulgaria, have taken control of the local economy, making a profit while we stay poor. Everyone agrees that we must help the Greeks of Thrace, with some saying we must do it diplomatically, and other, more ridiculous voices calling on us to go to war against the Bulgarians. Still, many more feel that the answer lies in between. \n\nTo put it succinctly, we all have our own ideas of how to handle the problem, and two main ideas have emerged in Parliament: the EFM's proposal is diplomatic, proposing demilitarisation of the region and de-escalation of tensions through negotiations. Furthermore, the EFM proposes putting pressure on Bulgaria through lobbying groups and protests, in an effort to pester them into granting the Greek population equal rights. This is, of course, the safe option, but at the same time would be an admittance that our casualties were, ultimately, for nothing - a fact which would no doubt be extremely unpopular, even for the standards of our unpopular government. \n\nMeanwhile, the EESM has a more radical plan, funding Greek rebels in Thrace with the plan of bringing about an anti-Bulgarian insurgency, which would be covertly backed by us. Following a Greek victory in the insurgency, the rebels would join the government, and we would accept. This plan, quite obviously, carries significant risks though, and if we do not manage to maintain a reasonable doubt that we are the ones supporting the insurgents, a war between us and Bulgaria could occur - one that would no doubt prove disastrous and be in their favour. While both sides jockey for support, at the end of the day we must make our choice. What shall we do to help the Greeks of Thrace and Kavala?"

No, the Italian Fasce did not just smash through the light of democracy that had previously shown over the myriad isles of our country, it buried its blade deep within our nation's. Maiming not just thousands of those young men lucky to return from the battlefields but ravaging our country's industry and most importantly agriculture. \n\nWith Greece long relying on its own soil to feed its people this bound us to the Roman Eagle almost more than the troops stationed throughout our country, loans and grain shipments from Italy preventing us from plunging into famine. Worse came to worse and as our esteemed leader Ioannis Rallis lies dead at assassin's blade the future is more murky than ever before, with the main camps of our administration both proposing something drastically different. \n\nThe Hellenic Fascist Front (EFM) seeks to tie our destiny even more to Rome as we shall take large loans from them to invest in much needed destroyed infrastructure and factories, the potential economic boost could be immense as both consumer goods and job opportunities flow once more into our country. Yet as with all loans, the bill will come due and even with the potential influx of economic growth and raw cash it is unclear whether we will be able to stomach it all. \n\nSecond the Hellenic National Socialist Front (EESM) seeks to return both literally and figuratively to our roots, focusing on our long honed craft of agriculture with subsidies and training and finally perfecting our corporate vision with organizing all agricultural under the newly created Hellenic Agricultural Guild. An umbrella organization promoting initiatives to improve the production and lot of the farmers. This would see putting a lot of our eggs into one basket, yet whilst this overcommitment to one sector could spell doom to the other sectors of the economy, there will be no fallout with potential debts to be repaid."

Although the traditionalist "Organization X" (X) partisans joined forces with us in 1947 to oppose the EAM-ELLAS, we're still fighting an uphill battle. \n\nEveryone in parliament knows that decisive action needs to be taken, but they're divided over what that should entail. It's been suggested by the parliament's "moderate" faction, the Hellenic Fascist Front (EFM), that the best way to quell the EAM-ELLAS would be to reach out to the EDES-EKKA leadership and discuss the possibility of forming an anti-communist pact of some description. The more radical, hardline Hellenic National Socialist Front (EESM) has refused to consider the possibility of a compromise and wishes to see harsher measures taken against both groups.

The Greeks suffered too long from this terror imposed on them by Italy, and many saw the significance of the rebellion that would be needed to free the people from the slavery in which they now find themselves, anchored under the sun that kills them.

Basil's heart seized at the words. Manolas - that could only mean that Uncle Themis and his clubfoot son - Basil turned to the judge, his gaze pleading. "Please, Your Honor - I can vouchsafe for Uncle Themis. He has done no wrong - " \n\nThe judge's gaze turned to ice. "We decide who is wrong and who is right. The pure and the polluted have between them a sharp division - and your sympathy will only drag you closer to that line, boy." He waved a dismissive hand. "Tell your mother I say hello. And remind her that it is only through obedience that we remain pure." \n\nBasil averted his eyes as the Manolases walked in, young Nikolas limping behind them. It would be better to forget. Better still to dry the tears welling from his eyes. Only damnation awaited them now, and he had a mother to protect."

Alexios' neck hackles, and his skin stands on end, as he knows - with the feel borne by every soldier - that they are lining the children up against the walls of his home. A growl. "We found the neighbours' kids. Come out or they get it. One by one. We start young." Alexios can hear the leer in the soldier's voice, thick and nauseating. "Very young." \n\nAlexios grips his rifle like a curse as he pads his way out of his room. The rifle-butt slams into his head, and as he is dragged out into the street he can hear the gunshots. Pop by pop, like a child's toy. \n\nAs the charges are read to him, Alexios spits in the face of his unseen assailants. The Italians were scum. These men are nothing more than monsters. He barely even registers the first stone hitting his face as he mouths wordless obscenities - and then he is dead. \n\nThe Battalion Sergeant nods impatiently at his men to clean up the corpses.

When every name had been scratched off, their target became anyone who wasn't Greek. And after that, it was anyone they pleased. The young and the old, the sick and the lame, nobody was spared. During this fanatical massacre, being on the streets was tantamount to a death sentence. \n\nBy the next morning, Athens was a ghost town. The only noises audible being the dying embers of several blazes around the city. Every street corner now had three grim staples: a shattered window, a pile of burnt books, and a body dangling by their neck. The city appeared as if it had been sacked. However, this time it was not by Persians, or Romans, or Germanic barbarians. It was by her own people, minds sick and twisted by their own fanaticism. The world was stunned by the brutality.

While the balding fool of an ambassador "signed" away Kavala and Thrace back to us, their rightful owners, our boys continued to decimate the Bulgarian formations and take over village after village.

As the sack and the gag were removed, Bourantas began scream against the officers standing in front of him. Calling them traitors, judeo-bolshevik agents and much more. But his attempts to try to look supreme over those who have sealed his fate were futile.

You are hereby sentenced to death by being thrown into Kaiadas.

Four candidates for Bourantas' position have emerged within the SB's: Athenian police chief Angelos Evert, first lieutenant Panos Katsareas, sergeant-major Takis Makedonas, and "captain" Grigoris Sourlas. These four men were the only witnesses to the marshal's true fate, and each of them now aspires to take his place. They weren't certain what each other's ulterior motives were on that fateful night in Kaidas, but they knew their alliance had always been one of convenience.

He was arrested outside his house today on charges of sedition, an accusation that Evert's friends in the M16 had helped him construct. Katsareas went quietly enough with his head lowered in resignation. He's set to be tried without delay.\n\nAs an award for his valiant work in fighting the partisans, sergeant Makedonas has been appointed the governor of scenic Gyaros, a remote island inhabited only by a large bob of monitor seals. He's tasked with overseeing the operations of the garrison there. In practice, this mostly involves idly watching the seals that rest on the shores and drinking large amounts of rakı and ouzo. While Makedonas' men are reportedly enjoying their new assignment, Makedonas is more depressed and angry about the situation than he lets on in his reports. One soldier claims that Makedonas now spends his evenings stumbling along the shore and drunkenly raving at the seals for not respecting his authority.\n\nAfter acquiring a warrant from a sympathetic judge, a party of Evert's officers was sent to arrest "captain" Sourlas at his gang's hideout in Demerli. The officers stormed the compound at dawn after correctly assuming the "bloody bandit" would refuse to go quietly. In the ensuing firefight, the farm house that Sourlas barricaded himself in caught fire. He was fatally injured when a stray beam fell from the foyer and struck him in the head.\n\nWith every possible threat to his ascent out of the picture, Evert has declared himself the acting marshal of the SB's and Greece's commander in chief. He announced in a state press release that despite the chaos of the past decade, Greece will soon be making a "return to peace and normalcy."

"The communists will come for you and your families next. Your country needs you. Will you answer the call?" \n\nLater that evening, a news bulletin went out across all of Greece that the lieutenant was to succeed Bourantas as the new marshal. He used his newfound authority to declare a state of emergency. A bulletin went out for the arrest of chief Evert, sergeant Makedonas, and "captain" Sourlas, as well as a number of other alleged communists within the SB's . In the subsequent purges, Katsareas enjoyed firm backing from what remained of the royalist old guard in the Greek military. As much as the high command disliked the SB's for being uncouth and ill-disciplined, they found the lieutenant to be tolerable enough to cooperate with.\n\nBy the time that what would later be referred to as the "white terror" was over, the death toll was unambiguously in the hundreds.

As the newly self-appointed marshal of the Security Battalions (SBs), Makedonas declared in a radio address that Greece and its armed forces had been plagued by petty in-fighting for too long. The country needed a unifying purpose to motivate change. He finished his address by stating that "the crucible of war" will bring about Greece's "regeneration."Makedonas reasoned that chief Evert was prestigious enough that outright purging him wasn't worth the potential backlash from his supporters in the uniformed police. For his years of service in the line of duty, Evert has instead received a prestigious new assignment. He's set to lead peace-keeping operations in the region of Epirus , where partisan attacks have become particularly severe and destructive over the past year. His experience will be invaluable given the high casualty rate for security officers in the area. \n\nKatsareas and the EAOK will likewise be assigned to in the same geographic area as an auxiliary force to the uniformed military.

In the dining room where the captain addressed them, the lifeless body of sergeant Makedonas was sprawled face-down on the dinner table. A farmer's billhook jutted out of his neck and his fatigues were encrusted with dark arterial blood. Sourlas told of how he'd lured the sergeant to his doom with promises that he would support his bid to be the new marshal, and that they should discuss the matter over dinner. "The others will not go as easily," the captain said while stroking his beard. "They are not so prone to flattery."\n\nThey rode from Demerli at dawn, their saddlebags stuffed with spare magazines and weapons of war. Lieutenant Katsareas was ambushed on a country road while returning to Thessaloniki from a meeting with several other EAOK officers in Litochoro. His motorcade was stopped at an impromptu roadblock made up of a few derelict cars. As his men exited the forward truck to move the wreckage, a figure emerged from the brush on a nearby ridge and fired a panzerfaust at the Mercedes-Benz the lieutenant was sitting in. Before the burning tires and his body parts could hit the ground, the thundering of dozens of hooves filled the air. A legion of war horses descended on the concussed survivors, their howling riders swinging trench clubs and rifle bayonets. By the time the smoke settled, all nine of the lieutenant's bodyguards had been brained, gunned down, or trampled in the melee.\n\nLater that same day, the streets of Athens ran red with blood after the captain's men converged on chief Evert's precinct station. The besieged officers fired down from the upper stories as the raiders surrounded the building. Just as they'd done to countless rural farmsteads, they chucked bottles of burning pitch through the first floor windows to smoke the traitors out.

The man swivels, pulls a gun from his holster and aims it at a passing servant. \n\nThe servant freezes. The Waffen-SS guards turn in alarm. The trigger clicks. It's an empty chamber. \n\nAs the servant crumples, trembling, the man only laughs. "We want power. Take your ships and stay, or go. We only want to be left alone to use this - power - on those who are weak. Is this not what the Reich teaches?" \n\nThe Ambassador stares, wordless, at the offered agreement, at the shivering man before him - and history rushes in the single stroke of a pen."

Why does this diplomatic victory feel so much like a moral surrender? And will he ever quite be able to live with himself, knowing what he's acquiesced to? \n\nThe Generals surrounding the Delegation guffaw with no trace of reserve. One of them yells at unseen servants to bring in the wine and fine food - there will be a celebration tonight, and the finest Aryan specimens will be brought in for the occasion! The Ambassador pretends not to hear, of course - he can only bear so much indignity for one day. \n\nThe evening's festivities are no respite for the man, however. The ceremony begins with several obviously unhappy maidens being prodded onto stage, performing what can only be described as...compromising dances to bawdy music. The "Aryans" of the Hellenic State laugh and catcall to them, their faces drunk with victory and alcohol in equal measure. \n\nThen the centrepiece of the night's festivities is wheeled out - as the jeering begins, the blinded man staggers on stage. Blood coats his back from the unmistakable welts of whipping. "Tell them, little kitten! Tell us of what happened to your little hovel!" \n\nThe man weeps, a wild caterwauling sound that slices through the heart. "My darling daughter killed - in front of me - I wish God had never granted me eyes. And the village - I could smell the roasting flesh, hear the screams - " and his cries are swept up in the wild horrific joy of the Aryans of Greece, the rulers of the Hellenic State. The petty kings of a nightmare state."

I trust that the Reich's esteemed intelligence services have delivered what this letter was intended to convey ahead of time: it is with deepest guilt that I admit that I can no longer stand before you and tell you what I did with a clear conscience. \n\nThe truth, Mila, is that I stood by today. I watched the Greek barbarians - no, the Greek savages - murder their petty way through the city of Socrates and Plato, and I did nothing to stop them. \n\nHow could I? I was on Government business. And yet what I saw broke, finally and irrevocably, my desperate conviction that the State was more important than my own convictions. \n\nI will - I wish so much to spare you, my love, but I want you to understand that I saw women and children hung, like skylights, for kilometers at a stretch. They were not men - the men had the mercy of being killed first - but the women and children, they - the blood stretched like paint smears - \n\nI apologise. Let me recollect myself. \n\nThe blood stretched like paint smears across the streets. I saw them, Mila. I saw the families herded into the hanging trees, I saw the bayonets, I saw it all. And as I died there, I questioned God on his meaningless violent throne, how could they do this? \n\nAnd what did we teach them, in their petty little furies, to emulate? \n\nI cannot live with what our nation has trained here, and certainly I do not desire forgiveness. Know this, Mila, I have loved you to the utmost. And yet that which I saw in Greece is a hate has triumphed beyond even that."

It's almost relieving to spit the words in the face of the men the Ambassador despises so. These people have threatened to murder servants not because they were Jewish, but because they were prey. They are far worse than the Reich. The German people are better than this. \n\nThat is what the Ambassador tells himself, even if he cannot bring himself to believe it. \n\nThe reaction is, at the very least, honest and heartfelt. The generals rise, almost as one, and raise their assembled firearms at the Delegation. The Waffen-SS, rifles shaking in anticipation, wait for orders. It appears that war has come again to Greece, and in the most ironic of ways. \n\nThe Ambassador clears his throat, a sudden loudness in the razor-sharp silence. "If you do not escort us from this place unharmed, the Hellenic State will be at war with the Reich. Would you like to find out how well your merry band does against the real Aryans?" \n\nThe generals are uncertain, and at last they move aside. One of them snaps at them to leave the country at once - a request the Ambassador is only too happy to oblige. Within the hour the Delegation leaves Larissa, and within the day a plane arrives in Athens to receive them. \n\nThe Ambassador, ordered to explain himself in Germania, merely admits to this: that he had been a soldier once, and that he had known the men who could be trusted were very different from the brutes. And, he emphasizes, the men of the Security Battalions of Greece are not of the former breed of humans. One memorable phrase he utters, "wolves in human skin", goes on to hit German newspapers - it is an instant bestseller, combined with eyewitness reports of the brutality of the little nation."

He pauses at the youngest, a boy of no more than fifteen, surely. \n\n"We'll see about who's the real pack of wolves, won't we, men?" He raises his voice to hit the mob of Verbandiers surrounding them. "Yes, we'll show them how the real Aryans act, and who the helpless little kittens really are." He tilts the head of the boy, smiling crookedly. "Bring me the wolf skin." \n\nThe pelt is disgusting to touch and to smell. It is rank and gelatinous with congealed fluid. In the face of armed men, however, the boy does not hesitate to slip on the bloody patch of fur. As he watches, the armed men offer similar patches to the prisoners around them, loosening their bonds in the process. \n\nThe men drag the wolf-clad to the edge of a stream. The General, smiling, pats the head of the boy. "I'm told that wolves have this fabulous ability to swim. So, boy, how about a swimming contest?" \n\nThe boy pauses. He stares at the water, surely no more than ten degrees. He'll die in minutes. \n\nThere is no levity in the General's face. "That was not a question. That was an order." Behind them, a shot rings out and a body tumbles to the floor - wolf's skin stained with fresh blood. "Swim, little cub. Swim. And you might yet see the next dawn.""

The machine guns roar and shudder for a full minute, swinging back and forth, back and forth - like the blades of an immense fan. \n\nIt takes thirty-seven minutes to clear the blood from the steps. \n\nThe next wave is that of the hapless laborers who have been held at gunpoint for weeks, building something squat and ugly and wrong beyond measure on the steps of the Parthenon. A swastika emblem, its ungainly ridges and hunched eagles, is etched into a massive stone block - its edges still rough and half-sanded, and some stained with blood. Nobody notices the occasional gunshot, or the corpse hurriedly carried off the marbled half-steps. \n\nWhen the emblem is finished, the laborers are hoisted to the side as an officer makes a toast. To Victory! He shouts it aloud, and in his voice is something far wilder and more savage than the wolf's basest impulse. As the rest cheer in response, the laborers make a break for it, running for the cover of the streets. \n\nSome of them get as far as ten metres before they are cut down. \n\nNight falls. The city burns in a dozen places. Now women and children begin to slip into the streets, step by wicked step, in the desperate hopes that the barricades will be blind and unguarded.

I know very well what exactly you work for and when you work. You can't hide everything you've done so far forever because we'll dig you out of any pit you hide in. " "I don't know what you're talking about." There were his panicked words as he swallowed a lump in his throat that touched the coldness of the steel knife that was pressed against his neck. Starting to bring the knife closer to his neck, pressing harder now, the man was only a few inches from his face so Evert could see what was happening in his eyes at this moment. "We know that you hid the Jews during all this time, son of a bitch. And more importantly - we know how you managed to do that. So we want to ask you for a small, small favor if you really love life.

You realize when it's too late, but you're ready to do as you're told. You will do the following - you will undo all the documents you have created so far to help you get the dirty creatures out. And you'll bring them back here to play with them a little. Is this completely understandable to you? " "Yes," Evert said, watching the death-sowing creature look away from his and head for the door.

Then he approached with a trembling step in the direction of the "throne" which was only ten meters from his position holding the crown in his hands. After finally approaching him, he sat down in his place, constantly thinking about the fact that one of the SB pigs could break his neck if he wants to and that no one will stop him in it or that if he wants to - he will not survive. Taking his place, a man approached him from behind and continued to carry the crown with calm hands, saying the words he had to learn in order to be able to do what he wanted. After some time of talking about the sacred duties of the king of a nation and things like that,the SB decided to immortalize this moment by lowering the crown on Paul's head, proclaiming him king of all Helens, saying that this would bring stability while a robbery and shootings broke out in the neighboring block in which members of the SB were involved, but no one was allowed to do anything now.

In the middle of the night, in the middle of their sleep, they took them out into the street, leading them to a dead end street that no one really knew existed.
