 SOV_kruglov_vision:0 "Director Kruglov's Report"
 SOV_kruglov_vision_desc:0 "In these unprecedented times, we are forced to call for unprecedented measures. The Union we know and love, the Union it has been my honor to serve, has suffered greatly from the malevolence of those who would have established a Degenerated Surveillance State in its ruins. They wrap themselves around every aspect of our daily life, and when it is time to call upon them they deny all accountability, even to the State and the Party - they believe they are the instrument of Lenin himself, above suspicion, above the Revolution, above the people. \n\nWe can no longer afford inaction, nor can we pretend that these hostile influences will disappear without inaction. I am asking you for a new Kronstadt. I am asking you to join me - so that we might save this Union from drowning on dry land."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_flames:0 "The NKVD In Flames"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_flames_desc:0 "We have received reports that hostile activities are taking place against the so-called Internal Security elements of the Union, spearheaded by workers' organizations and the Red Army. This is not an unexpected response, nor is it something to fear. The sword of the wrathful Soviet worker cleanses at the touch, separating the good from the bad. And surely the NKVD of all Bureaus must understand the redemptive effects of revolutionary violence? \n\nWe ask only that those hostile elements within the Service submit themselves to the judgement that is rightly due them - all revolutionaries make mistakes, and in your service will lie forgiveness. If that is forfeited, however...you will come to realise the depth of your errors."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_legacy_of_kalinin:0 "Legacy Of Kalininism"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_legacy_of_kalinin_desc:0 "Kalinin was a mentor to all of us, the father of the new Union, and the guiding hand keeping us away from some of our inherent excesses. Our deviations from the centralized production model led us into the hands of jackals and predators - I will not allow a recurrence in my capacity as Chairman. As we cast the horrors of the recent past away, let us instead look to the model that kept us alive even as the Deviationists tore down our works and the Germans feasted on our kind. \n\nKalininism works, my friends. With its light we were led to safety, without it we shall be extinguished. Let us hold the torch with a careful hand, and one day we might yet look upon the liberation of our nation and the world with clear eyes."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_democratic_centralism:0 "Kalininist Democratic Centralism"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_democratic_centralism_desc:0 "Friends, let us speak of the worker. Perhaps here, in the Politburo, we have spoken at lacquered tables so long that we have forgotten how the people we serve actually live. This must explain why the petty politics of our little country-club seem so large on our minds - and why the country has languished under our failures, as if the Tsar had never died and the Vodka Tax was enforced still from Petrograd. \n\nLet us speak of the worker, and of how loyal we truly are to the dream of a state built to empower our people. For when we are honest in our failings, we can begin necessary corrections - and is that not the essence of an honest Marxist?"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_rehabilitate_stalin:0 "Officially Re-Habilitate Stalin"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_rehabilitate_stalin_desc:0 "Many ask why I have declared a Period of Introspection on the wartime Premier, Josef Vissarionovich Jugashvili. I ask you this: how can a nation without a clear understanding of its past ever gaze clearly at its future? Yes, Premier Stalin accumulated excesses in his regime. Yes, many of his actions were individually lamentable. They were also, however, critical in ensuring our industrial base stood strong enough to resist the Germans - if we crumbled after 2 years with Stalin, how long could we have lasted without his Five-Year Plans? \n\nComrade Stalin was not always a wise leader, but he was a visionary, a man who built the steel-and-iron dream our nation still reaches for. Let us forgive his excesses and honor what we can of his memory - and let us hope that when the Revolution sweeps the world, our descendants will judge us with the same mercy that we have judged our fathers."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_deberiazation:0 "De-Beriazation"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_deberiazation_desc:0 "I wish to discuss with you one of the most pressing problems I have seen in the Union of today - I term this problem Beriaization, after the policies of one of my unlamented predecessors. It is a soft word for all the horror it invokes - for Beriaization is nothing less than the institutional perversion of Socialist Idealism to the ends of personal gain for a select few. The neo-bourgeois gained his wealth leeching off the farmer, the NKVD Commissar gained power leeching off the citizenry, and like a monstrous squid hunched over some infernal machine, Beria stood at the centre of it all. \n\nThese monstrosities were inhumane, un-Socialist and oppressive to the working class, and we shall waste no time in undoing them. From the fields to the torture chambers, let it be known: the State is coming to liberate the citizens of Russia, and it will sweep its enemies away."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_power_to_politburo:0 "Transfer Excessive Power To The Politburo"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_power_to_politburo_desc:0 "We condemned Premier Stalin for his manifest failings - his personality cult, his inability to adapt, and his jealous hoarding of power from the Politburo - and yet I find myself shackled by the very same chains we all bemoaned. Let us be clear. I am no Stalin, nor am I interested in ruling by decree as the Politburo and the Party sit in terrified awe, as Stalin did. The last use of my unlimited executive authority, therefore, will be to limit it: the Bill sitting before you aims to create in the Politburo standing institutions to enforce the rule of law over me and my successors. \n\nThe Chairman's role will also itself be limited: as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Union, I will bind my decrees to a vote made within the Party leadership itself. I will admit that debating the minutiae of agrarian reforms does not inspire in me the greatest of zeal, but we must all make sacrifices for the Union's health."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_party_democracy:0 "Restore Party Democracy"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_party_democracy_desc:0 "I have found, in my studies on the evolution of the Party, that one critical and worrying trend has emerged in all Revolutionary activities we have undertaken: the trend of power to move from the many to the few. Despite our talk of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, many have voiced their private concerns to me that we are becoming a Dictatorship of the Few, and that we will evolve into a pure Dictatorship as surely as day follows night. \n\nI must counter this tendency, which is surely a deviation from our aim of bringing liberation to the masses, wherever it is found. The opening of our inaugural Party Elections this year will allow for the contestation of multiple candidates for a representative position - and those found guilty of suborning the will of the people by sabotaging their candidates will be dealt with as harshly as is necessary."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_central_committee_elections:0 "Have The Politburo Elect Ministers"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_central_committee_elections_desc:0 "As we continue to decentralize the Apparatus of State, it is my duty as Chairman to point out a focal duty for the Politburo to consider: our Ministers will serve alongside and in charge of all of you, and yet it is the Premiership that holds the reins of appointment. What an outrageous idea, and how utterly antithetical to the ideals of Soviet Democracy it is! Ministerial appointments will henceforth be proposed, evaluated and decided entirely within the Politburo itself. \n\nIf the enemies of the people, by some unlikely stroke of fate, infiltrate the highest offices of the State, I will retain extraordinary powers to retract these positions from individuals. Rest assured, friends, that it is unlikely this privilege will be exercised - and if it is exercised, we will have far greater problems to deal with than mere ministers."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_anti_factionalism:0 "Anti-Factionalist Meritocracy"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_anti_factionalism_desc:0 "Our ultimate aim shall be the purging, in substance and spirit, of the reactionary elements that plagued the Union. While the appointment of bureaucrats and senior statesmen was based on securing the power of individuals, the collective suffered grievously for it. Such was the atmosphere that led to the Lysenkoist disaster under Premier Stalin, which caused a rapid collapse in grain outputs. It shall not be allowed to happen again. \n\nTo prevent another Lysenko, we must first cleanse this Politburo: I now appeal to all of you to give up your petty allegiances that interfere with the functioning of this State - and for those who will not comply, the harshest punishments we can bestow upon traitors will be awarded you."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_roll_back_nkvd:0 "Roll Back Local NKVD Political Powers"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_roll_back_nkvd_desc:0 "As the age of the worker dawns, the age of the Commissar must decline. It is an inevitability, and one worth celebrating at that - when the workers have grown strong enough in their ideological consciousness to seize power, we will know the State has succeeded in their education. With this success comes the opportunity to remove the potential for imposed deviations, particularly those who would use the power of the Commissar to install the fear imposed by a tyrant. \n\nEven in its shrunken state, there is hope for the NKVD: we shall repurpose it entirely, moving it into a role that truly befits internal security. The Commissars will never be allowed near real political power again, and in this domestic position they will focus their efforts on real enemies, not imagined or convenient ones."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_direct_elections_always:0 "Direct Election To All Local Soviets"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_direct_elections_always_desc:0 "All Power to the Soviets! Let that sound echo in our ears, comrades, for it is time to put the Praxis of Lenin into practice. All Power must only mean one thing - the ultimate access of power and political will to the average worker we have struggled to protect. Yes, the Vanguard Party stands not just as protective bulwark, but as active champion of the democratic will, and our relaxed restrictions on local elections will ensure that this will is not subverted through single-candidate elections. \n\nWith this act, we fulfil the mandate set before us by the crowds of the Petrograd Soviet so long ago, and we lay to rest the men and women who died in the Patriotic War: as they died to make the Union safe, so too shall we live to make its people free."
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_kalininist_democracy:0 "The Guiding Light Of Kalinin"
 SOV_kruglov_nkvd_kalininist_democracy_desc:0 "I have spoken to you at every opportunity possible of the dream upheld by Comrade Kalinin, and it is with great joy that I now declare that dream fulfilled. Soviet Socialism will never have a solid foundation apart from the worker, and that foundation is now solidly in place: the worker's voice rings undimmed and clear into the Party designed to channel it.

I have never been deceptive about my distaste for the unabashed exploitation that took place under the crypto New-Economic-Policy, forced into being by the War and manipulated into a permanent fixture by those who would benefit from it. And look how they have benefited, comrades! They make hundreds of times the salary of the farmers they oppress, and we sponsor their horrific luxuries in the name of stability. What a travesty to the Soviet State! \n\nThe time has come to destroy these aberrant businessmen just as we destroyed their fathers, the noble class.

Through the grievous error of privatisation we encouraged not prosperity, but inequality of growth, for the value of their work was siphoned off to the middlemen who sold them. We must remedy this error through any means necessary, and the Agricultural Adjustment Act will act as a starter-course. \n\nPrivate land will be purchased by the State at fixed prices and their material value redistributed to individual farmers. These plots will be the breeding ground for a glorious new system, the Sovkhoz system, where all land is owned by the state. It will be a new dawn for Farmers, and for the Union as a whole."

It is incoherent, distasteful - and so is our toleration, our generosity even, to the protobourgeois classes that have emerged from these experiments in capitalism.

These so-called agents of the state can, through this power, wield the power of judge, jury and executioners in the name of the Union, sending multitudes to a fate worse than death without any pretence of a court of Law. A vile abuse of the trust our fathers placed in them, and utterly unworthy of this Bureau - we will remove this privilege at once, and raid the offices of this Bureau for good measure. \n\nI would caution you all, comrades - we are not entirely safe from their reaches, and if anyone here believes himself to be under threat of bodily harm, it would be best to stay away from the Politburo for a few weeks.

Rapid allocations of NKVD members to vital security installations like the Gulag system and remote meteorological facilities shall serve as the first step to their re-education, a process that will no doubt take decades to complete. \n\nRegular classes will reskill these unfortunate workers in trades that truly benefit the Union.

With the Formal Political Exclusion Act, we shall at last bring these dreams back into the spotlight, for with this Act we shall bar the NKVD from political positions and end its association with the Party. \n\nNow, comrades, is the time to celebrate.

And so much yet remains to be done, for the old lands taken from us cry out to be liberated. Comrades, as we build the Soviet Dream, let us never forget that the Union looks not just inward for its completion, but outward. \n\nAnd as we look upon the Motherland, that which could yet be ours again, let the hope arise - our Russia shall yet be strong, free and whole, for if History is on our side, nothing could stand against us."

To the west, the Germans and their puppets rape and desicrate our homes. To the east, warlords and upstarts challenge our sovereign legitimacy. It is time for change once again, it is time to rejuvenate our great nation and end the half century of humiliation!\n\n" The room bursts into applause. On a raised balcony, Alexander Novikov watches carefully. Noting those few who refrain from clapping.\n\nAs the speech continues, Bulganin explains that Marxist-Leninism has clearly failed, and a new direction for the Russian people is needed.

 twrsoviet.20.t:0 "The Lens Reversed"
 twrsoviet.20.d:0 "Some are calling it a bold literary reimagining of history, others the scrabblings of a madman; either way, Fyodor Ivanov's new novel The Lens Reversed is a work that cannot be ignored. The novel, published under Party auspices in the Soviet Union and disseminated, with much difficulty, by Marxist organizations across the world, describes a world where much the Roman Empire never fell - it embarked on the liberation of the South and North over the course of five centuries, before splitting into four cardinal directions.\n\nBut Europe, in this world, is but a backwater to the book's real focus in Asia: a rapidly modernizing Japan has colonized much of North America and Southern Africa, and in the Mongolian-Russian plains the strange, egalitarian creed of the Mongolian State has carved out a new vision for humanity. Ivanov's Mongolian protagonist, Bilguun, takes part in several pivotal struggles between the State and its imperialist American and Japanese rivals, including a long, bloody war along the Manchurian border that is a transparent parallel to the Great Patriotic War Ivanov himself experienced.\n\nAs Bilguun struggles against the decadence of his countrymen, he begins to take an active role in his country's own politics, while at the same time shaping the men and women around him into a noble, self-sacrificing force for the greater good. The novel ends on both a narrative and a global cliffhanger, with Bilguun announcing his abdication in favor of Yan Gamarnik, a follower of the strange new creed of Romanism, this timeline's equivalent of Socialism, and rebuild his world anew in the image of the militant-worker - as the Japanese and the Mongolians race towards nuclear weaponry, it is clear that the coming storm will be far more brutal than the last.\n\nInternational reaction has been mixed - one reviewer bitterly argues that "if statesmen were meant to dream about implausible worlds, perhaps Churchill would have kept his job" - but on the whole the novel has received a positive response. Several Asian Communist leaders have already noted the prominent role of Central Asian proto-socialist movements in the work as an implicit endorsement of their own struggles for national liberation, and the work has even made its way into the office of Ho Chin Minh himself, albeit in a much-abridged form."

 twrsoviet.21.d:0 "The Premier watches as the Mother - for that is what the sculptor calls her - is unveiled from the canvas that hides her. It's a relatively lightweight frame for a monument, and around the woman the still-scaffolded ruins of Moscow cast a grim backdrop to its hulking, brooding shape. \n\nNow the sculptor - Yevgeny Vuchetich, is that right - saunters to the Premier, his hand extended in subtle warmth. "Welcome to Moscow, Premier." He sweeps his hand at the statue of the Mother, its eyes darkened in shadow. "Welcome to my little handiwork - if you'll pardon the unfinished state." The Premier chuckles.\n\n"Thank you, Comrade Vuchetich. Even now, I can see the strength in her eyes." The statue exudes the latter, even with the strain visible from the child in the Mother's arms. The gaunt look about the Mother's face is framed in subtle, clenched jaws, and her fists are half-clenched. "Yes, strength and pain - fitting. It is a beautiful statue."\n\nVuchetich's own eyes grow distant. "Did you know, Premier? I planned this statue with my wife on my heart. She did not escape Leningrad, the poor fool." He's whispering now, a confession - or a plea. "I thought of how she would look with the child we raised, if she had known we would take it all back. This will bear her image, even if the face is not hers - please forgive this little transgression, Premier."\n\nThe Premier's words shock the little grey-haired man. "If she were here, Comrade Vuchetich, I know she would be proud. The blood of our martyrs is shed in hope." A hand is proffered. "And standing here, on sacred ground - I believe that hope has been fulfilled.""
 twrsoviet.21.a:0 "The two were silent for a long while, as the statue watched on."
 twrsoviet.22.t:0 "The Military Schism"
 twrsoviet.22.d:0 "As we work to make the necessary reforms to the country and system, the time has finally come to reform the armed forces. The army of our country has been tainted by Soviet fanaticism. It has committed numerous unjust acts in the name of the Bolshevik ideology, something we now know to be flawed. If our country is to be properly reformed away from this twisted form of socialism, we must work to remove any forces that may counter our reforms from the armed forces. With any luck, none of them will get any ideas of resisting these necessary changes..."
 twrsoviet.22.a:0 "The military stays loyal!"
 twrsoviet.22.b:0 "Hybridists take over!"
 twrsoviet.23.t:0 "Depoliticization Completed"
 twrsoviet.23.d:0 "Despite worries of backlash from the armed forces, the delicate balance has been maintained and the 'depoliticization' of the armed forces has been satisfarily completed. Political commissars have been abolished, and some of the more ideologically committed Marxist-Leninists honorably removed from their posts, which has led to a minor officer shortage, but overall the reforms have been steady out of necessity. For now, Bulganin's regime survives."

Inmates who fall below quotas will be severely punished and hope to god they don't do it a second time, meanwhile, prisoners who show great Proletarian Behavior will be able to visit families and friends."
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_all_criminals:0 "Begin Phasing All Prisoners Into GULAGs"
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_labor_all_criminals_desc:0 "Now that we have finalized our efficient Gulag system to maximize production, we can abolish regular prisons which use inefficient and mostly optional labor programs. The Gulag shall become the staple of Soviet Law Enforcement and become main military production facilities, and so we have finally secured the Soviet economy for decades to come."
 SOV_kuznetsov_the_days_grow_dark:0 "The Days Grow Shadowed"
 SOV_kuznetsov_the_days_grow_dark_desc:0 "At 11:00 of [REDACTED], Sidorov Tomas Andreevich, a famous Craftsman who lived in the capital, was executed for the charges of Counter Revolution under Penal Code Article 58-1. Just seconds before Sidorov was executed he spoke his last words. \"For the days grow shadowed, Kuznetsov, the leader of the people has instead betrayed the int-\" The guards realized what happened and his execution was promptly sped up. The incident was leaked by a unknown guard and soon the capital was buzzing with rumors including a false story of Sidorov knowing of a corruption scandal and that the counter-revolutionary charge was fabricated."
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_economy:0 "The GULAG Economy"
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_economy_desc:0 "We have established the simple fact that for the Soviet Union to reclaim its old territory it must be able to have an effective and streamlined economy capable of putting out military products rapidly. In order to do that we must accept the additional fact that we need to prioritize Gulags over any other Economic Asset."
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_central_committee:0 "Politburo Naval Advisory Committee"
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_central_committee_desc:0 "The Navy maintains a lot of ties to the Red Army which had almost always maintained priority over the Navy. In our effort to punish the Red Army we must expand the government and party's influence over the Navy. For starters we can assemble a committee made of loyalists and naval experts so we have the power to halt anything that goes against our Anti-Red Army Agenda. The Committee is only a start and the Navy still thinks it is a mostly advisory organization. We must take other measures in the future."
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_security_branch:0 "NKVD Naval Security Branch"
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_security_branch_desc:0 "In order to root out both foreign and domestic enemies, most notably Red Army loyalists, we need a branch of the NKVD specializing in gathering intelligence in the ranks of dry and maritime sections of the Navy. By building a informant network we can prevent the recruitment of Red Army Supporters and Veterans and root out those who already take up positions of power."
 SOV_kuznetsov_the_lord_admiral:0 "The Lord Admiral Ascends"
 SOV_kuznetsov_the_lord_admiral_desc:0 "In order to maintain control over the Navy we need a permanent and good claim to an executive and powerful position within the Navy, For this we have created the Position of Lord Admiral of The Soviet Navy. By giving the position to Kuznetso we intertwine Soviet Executive Power and Naval Leadership into one. The High Command of the Soviet Navy merely at the Lord Admirals Whim."
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_draft:0 "Instituting The Naval Draft"
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_draft_desc:0 "With our Gulag Economy and highly efficient industry we now have the capability to field large fleets of ships that requires tens of thousands of Seamen and Sailors, which we do not have. To that we must begin conscripting able bodied males in the specific Naval Branch and devote more volunteers to the Navy rather than the Red Army which will help improve our naval strength while also damage the Manpower of the Red Army."
 SOV_kuznetsov_vampire_in_the_night:0 "Vampires In The Night"
 SOV_kuznetsov_vampire_in_the_night_desc:0 "The Red Army has a large amount of funding which contributes directly to the funding of traitorous Generals and cowardly Officers who failed us during the Great Patriotic War. With a little bit of corruption and sneaking around we can move funding from the Red Army and other Departments to the Navy, which has proven to be loyal and thus should be funded. Any General who notices this will unfortunately disappear the day of the budget change for unknown reasons."
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_budget_committee:0 "Naval National Budget Committee"
 SOV_kuznetsov_naval_budget_committee_desc:0 "We need to assemble a group of Loyalists who will form the National Budget Committee of the Navy, we can assure the government can oppose any budget cuts that will harm the government's agenda. A budget committee can be one of the most powerful tools we have and once we take back control of the Army we can create one for that branch as well."
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_subs:0 "GULAG Submarine Tours"
 SOV_kuznetsov_gulag_subs_desc:0 "The job of a submariner is a fate that many Volunteer and Conscript Sailors suffer. By replacing the Submariners with Kulaks and other inmates we can avoid a hit of morale to our professional Navy and gain more favor with the common sailor by saving them from the depths of the ocean."
 SOV_kuznetsov_token_investments:0 "Token Heavy Industry Projects"
 SOV_kuznetsov_token_investments_desc:0 "We need to convince the people that the economy outsides of the Gulags is growing, to do that we need to continue regular construction of factories in urban areas and give hope to the workers of the Union. Along with providing hope they will also contribute a small amount to our total industry, but not on the same scale as our Gulags."
 SOV_kuznetsov_coastal_relocation:0 "Population Coastalization Program"
 SOV_kuznetsov_coastal_relocation_desc:0 "Most of the lands we inhabit are unfortunately barren and rural, by pouring money into infrastructure to small towns on the northern coast we can rapidly speed up the growth of these towns and create a more coastal culture to go along with our big navy. The North Sea is a very strategic location and the only access we have to maritime industry so we must utilize all we can."
 SOV_kuznetsov_vorkuta_incident:0 "The Vorkuta Incident"
 SOV_kuznetsov_vorkuta_incident_desc:0 "The Vorkuta Gulag has over 65,000 Inmates and represents one of the largest Gulags in our possession. After the Gulag Chief Zoya Voskresenskaya decided to cut rations and put more budget to guards salary, 53,000 of the inmates rose up while the other 12,000 were separated from the riot. NKVD responded but local forces were too small while the Red Army was reluctant to help, we suspect the Red Army was purposely sabotaging our containment. 327 Prisoners are confirmed dead while 23 Guards died 14 NKVD Agents died. We need to work on preventing this from ever happening again and use measures to prevent apathetic press from leaking this."
 SOV_kuznetsov_uprising:0 "The Perm Uprising....."
 SOV_kuznetsov_uprising_desc:0 "Even after we put press restrictions the news passed by gossip and now the capital of Perm is in flames. An estimated 23,000 people are rioting, 56,000 are protesting, and 89,000 workers are on strike. If we act swiftly and violently we can give an example of what happens when counter revolutionaries corrupt the mind of the proletariat and prevent smaller cities and towns from falling to disorder."

In fact the October revolution and the following victory of the proletariat was only made possible through the weakness and idiocy of the last Tsar. \n\nAs such following Comrade Stalin's example Comrade Molotov shall become the new strongman of Union and the Motherland, guiding us in the next trying years."

SOV_handlelooseends_desc:0 "Comrade Molotov's rule over the Union is all but secure, already some of our support base have criticized or even turned against us following our new course. Lest we will be thrown in disarray once more, we will have to move quickly and crush any dissent and unify the supreme soviet once more."
SOV_stalinistdemocracy:0 "Stalinist Democracy"

SOV_handlethereformistmilitary:0 "Handle The Reformist Military"
SOV_handlethereformistmilitary_desc:0 "The Red Army despite being formally the sword and shield of the union, has even under the reign of Comrade Stalin become much more than that.

#########Ivanov Union##############
SOV_ivanov_union:0 "Ivanov's New Society"
SOV_ivanov_union_desc:0 "The great union of soviets has been reborn, guided by the proletarian light of Zhukovist democracy and socialism. There is much to be rebuilt, but there is much zeal amongst our people. The Communist Party, under the leadership of comrade Inanov, will help us pave the road to true liberation."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd:0 "Repurposing NKVD Manpower"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_desc:0 "Our Union has long had the NKVD at its throat, a knife placed upon the throat of the people. Any utility the agency once had has long since dissipated, and now it is a bloated mess of terror, corruption and anti-Soviet intrigue. Thankfully, Comade-Chairman Ivanov has a plan: We will take this agency and radically reshape it to our own needs, turning the intelligence of the intelligentsia to a new end entirely.\n\nThe precise contours of our needs, however, are very much in debate. Some argue that the NKVD should be moved into the realm of theory - others argue for a more practical approach. Whatever we decide, it is clear that the Agency is about to change forever."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine:0 "From Oppressors Into Philosophers"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_desc:0 "The Internal Affairs Commissariat was initially set up to solve the problems of the Soviet Union, to regulate the transition into a workers' state. Now that the workers' state is here, they are functionally irrelevant. However, this does not mean that the NKVD is entirely useless. Their vast intelligence and the skill with which they surveyed and monitored dissent can be turned to the intensive sphere of economic theory, which also requires the management of vast stores of information. More importantly, their penetration of all aspects of civilian life ensures that they will have access to civilian consumption patterns - the data practically pays for itself."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity:0 "From Thieves To Volunteers"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_desc:0 "Starting the process of reform for the most feared agency in the Union was never going to be easy. With expectations of entrenched opposition, the Premier has decided to take a more - ah - hands on approach to the process. We will drag the NKVD into the light by sending them into the cities and towns to perform public service. Trials by some of our Youth Corps Battalions have proven promising in the countryside, and the Premier has every hope of success.\n\nIf it does not succeed, of course, we will also threaten them with public action to hound them into submission, which should teach them a lesson or two about defying the will of the people."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_guards:0 "Orders Into Actions"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_guards_desc:0 "The root-and-branch reform of the Commissariat must start with its order system. The old NKVD was a mishmash of internal security departments with mandates to perform everything from policing to fire services, interlinked only by exchange of information and a common badge - this was what made the agency so ubiquitous and uncontrollable, even by Stalin himself.\n\nThis must change. The centralization of the Department into a single governing body accountable to the Politburo will limit abuses, and from this platform we can continue further reform."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_informants:0 "Secrets Into Theories"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_informants_desc:0 "The extensive files of the Security Apparatus are its most infamous aspect - it is known that every Soviet Citizen has either a file in the NKVD's halls or an imminent warrant for their arrest. We can, however, put this invasive data to good use by turning it all into economic data - consumption patterns, social group patterns and internal psychology can be traced from a person's life.\n\nAs we take the guns away from their hands, we will also give the Agency new life by instructing them to retabulate this data into a body of evidence our Economic Planning agencies can use, and build recommendations on its backbone. We will, of course, ensure this data is turned anonymous, starting with the senior members of the Politburo. Entirely for state security purposes, of course."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_officers:0 "Weapons Into Pamphlets"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_officers_desc:0 "The development of every security apparatus requires a propaganda effort, to disguise its tracks and to assure the public of their good will. This was true for the fascists and it will be true for us - the NKVD's next big step will be to redouble its external propaganda to reduce the negative reputation we have long had in the eyes of the people. Massive reductions in our internal use of violence will follow it, as we begin to outphase the Commissariat's violent tendencies altogether.\n\nSome might compare our efforts to attempting to put nice clothes on an already dead man, or to firemen arriving six hours after the house has already burnt to the ground. They might be right, but they are also utterly unhelpful. We will be sure to target them when the first batch of propaganda comes in."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_bureaucrats:0 "Meetings Into Debates"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_bureaucrats_desc:0 "The NKVD does not usually meet in private. It would be too easy to identify senior members who could in turn be targeted for blackmail by our own internal moles within the Service. Instead communications were done in private, between anonymous members of departments whose sole job was to pass orders given by unnamed superiors. This gave the NKVD its infamous reputation for impenetrability, and made it feared even in the eyes of the Red Army.\n\nThis will have to change. A forced Congress will reveal to the Politburo and Soviet people who the leaders are, painting a giant red bullseye on the leadership's backs should they fail in their desire to serve the Union - and it will encourage constructive discussions on the ongoing Theoreticization process, which is no doubt a useful secondary goal."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_leaders:0 "Power Into Praxis"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_leaders_desc:0 "The transition rolls on in the halls of the NKVD. As the Commissariat retools itself into a wholly theoretical organization, slowly but surely it has become beneficial to the Soviet people. Already suggestions from the Commisariat's new Advisory Boards (for some reason the civilian-oriented Boards are the most enthusiastic in this regard) have been received, on a wide range of economic and sociopolitical topics.\n\nWith little indication that the agency is returning to its old ways, we have also decided to increase their autonomy to go out and perform Marxist praxis within the population itself. They will take on advisory roles everywhere in the Government and the state agencies, building bridges and mending gaps. It will be a real rebirth for them - let us hope the Union is ready for it."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_operatives:0 "Silencers Into Megaphones"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_doctrine_operatives_desc:0 "The last step of dismantling an internal security organization is the destruction of its suppressive mechanisms. Every NKVD cell had a unique set of blackmail documents meant to suppress societal dissent within the organization or social sector they were located in - we will force these cells to destroy these materials, or face the retribution of a very, very angry Red Army.\n\nThese materials will be replaced with survey forms and census registration documents, to amplify the voices of the people where it matters. While the Internal Security Commissariat might never have thought of becoming a glorified survey team when it was first established, it is vastly preferable to the alternative. We will take every opportunity to remind them of this."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_philosophy_ministry:0 "The Ministry Of New Philosophy"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_philosophy_ministry_desc:0 "The formal establishment of the Ministry as a firmly theoretical instrument will allow us to do one last shakeup of the apparatus, rooting out any opposition to our plans that might have previously surfaced. As they are sent to the prison camps, their brethren will formally adopt the trappings of bureaucratic personnel without the violence that supported their activities. In time, the NKVD will be rehabilitated entirely - at least, that is the plan.\n\nWith a change in name comes a change in methodology. The Renunciation of Violence Act will forever destroy all hostile weaponry and equipment once in possession of the Ministry, and the records of all who were killed will be sent to State archives, where hopefully they will never appear again."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_guards:0 "Batons Into Hammers"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_guards_desc:0 "The Corrective Labor Order will be the first step to physically removing the Commissariat from its position of almighty power over our people. We will sentence all of the NKVD former leadership to the hard labor they deserve, to toil in labor facilities and in corrective farms. The bureaucrats, on the other hand, will get a gentler hand - they will only perform corrective labor for a matter of weeks, at factories and generally well-run state agencies.\n\nThe treatment will continue until they are willing to wholly renounce their previous actions, which will not take long at all. Once that is done, it will be time to fully reforge the Agency in the image we desire."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_informants:0 "Surveillance Into Service"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_informants_desc:0 "The surveillance of the NKVD has already begun to turn against them, in what we are referring to as the Backlash. It is time to further that by enforcing compulsory public service quotas through this surveillance system, punishing those who do not adhere to the orders we have issued. We will create an atmosphere of terror against those who do not demonstrate sufficient sorrow for their actions or dedication to their present assignments. And as for those who reject them entirely? We will release them to the mercies of their angry and disillusioned comrades."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_officers:0 "Rifles Into Sickles"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_officers_desc:0 "We will accelerate the movement of NKVD volunteers into the countryside, issuing members a compulsory set of farming equipment and orders to stay until their duties to the Soviet people are fulfilled. This will, of course, come at the cost of their weapons, which we are also confiscating in huge numbers. Those who are identified with weapons while on corrective service will be assumed to be insurgents and enemies of the people - and the Red Army has long had experience in dealing with insurgents."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_bureaucrats:0 "Papers Into Plans"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_bureaucrats_desc:0 "The Agricultural Planning Board has traditionally received orders from the Politburo alone, but this year they will have a helper to guide and assist them - NKVD remnants will be tasked with drawing up ambitious new plans with the manpower we have generously provided them. The fact that these new farming workers are also former NKVD agents will only increase the efficacy of this plan.\n\nWe will task the Planning Board to keep tabs on these agents as well, identifying hotspots of dissent so we can literally weed them out of our system."
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_leaders:0 "Privileges Into Obligations"
SOV_ivanov_nkvd_charity_leaders_desc:0 "The last task of securing the NKVD's loyalties will be to formally bind them to indefinite labor obligations within the sectors of society to which they have been assigned. These obligations will involve intangible deliverables as well as the tangible - they will be required to report on potential subversive activity on the part of their former colleagues, on pain of additional punishment by the state.\n\nAt some future date, we might consider withdrawing these obligations when they have served their purpose.

Many in the region see the expansionist country as a threat, and our proposal will no doubt be well received in many corners. With interests and military power, of course, comes influence - we will soon push the old borders to the edges of the Caucasus Range, and this fragment of the old dream shall be fragmented no longer. "

SOV_orlov_rectification_denationalization_desc:0 "The strategic oil reserves of the Caucasus region had always been guarded as a precious jewel, held close to the chest for fear of its spilling out - access to the oil market was almost non-existent outside of state industry and military purposes. This inefficiency must be rectified for the good of the Soviet state, and we will not tarry. The Strategic Resources Rationalisation Act, as drafted by senior members of the Politburo, will henceforth break up the state oil extraction operations into several private firms. The resulting competition, innovation and efficiency will only benefit us all."

SOV_orlov_rectification_karelia_desc:0 "Finland: the old enemy to the northwest and now a pressing geopolitical problem. The Karelian Territory fell to them as they capitalized off our collapse in the War, barring us from access to the Baltic Sea - this insult is nothing less than an attack on the sanctity of the Russian nation, and if we are ever to regain our place in the world, we must take back what was lost to us. An aggressive regimen of exercises on our border will prove just how dedicated we are to this cause, and if the Finns have anything to say on the matter, they will be free to air their grievances when our territory is once again in our hands."
SOV_orlov_rectification_karelia_airrecon:0 "Airborne Reconnaisance Division"
SOV_orlov_rectification_karelia_airrecon_desc:0 "The key to modern warfare is control of the air: with air supremacy comes the ability to identify enemy offensives before they have begun, the means to effectively combat these offensives without risking excess manpower, and a strategic leeway in identifying weak spots in the enemy line. Finland offers an opportunity to put this doctrine into motion. We will repurpose some of our special forces battalions to act as recon divisions from airborne deployments, crippling the Finnish army before the alarms are sounded at Helsinki."

SOV_orlov_rectification_karelia_airborne_insurgency_desc:0 "Our entry into airborne operations has given us a foundation upon which to build our offensive capabilities, but we will need time and effort to transform our forces into a genuine threat to the Finnish forces. Expansion in exercise scales and deployment sizes will give our airforce experience in large-scale offensive action, while our generals will work to implement coordinated airland-battle doctrine: when we are ready, our airborne forces will be the hammer and our ground forces the anvil, with the enemy caught between them both."

SOV_orlov_rectification_karelia_motorized_raids_desc:0 "The key to modern warfare is speed on the ground: with speed comes the ability to strike, destroy and retreat almost entirely undetected by central command, and the ability to identify and hit targets in a fraction of the time taken by conventional units. There is a cost to this, however, as our conventional motorized units are equipped for infantry-support roles. It will take time and money to retool our most advanced motorized formations into a true large-scale force capable of large-scale offensives - even so, it will be worth the effort when the Finns are pushed to their old borders."

SOV_orlov_rectification_karelia_motorized_pincers_desc:0 "The basic unit of any motorized-armor offensive is the encirclement, and the tool through which encirclements are achieved is always the pincer movement. By punching through multiple spots in the enemy line, we will be able to cut off supply lines and offensive capabilities virtually at will - what matters, however, is the efficiency and speed of our own forces while doing so. The development of sophisticated large-scale tactical formations, as well as autonomy training on the part of our battalion commanders, will improve both these criteria: it will, however, take a lot of administrative effort."

Our fighters perform twice-daily flybys of the front, and the thud of artillery is never distant. We are ready for war, should the Finnish seek it - and yet there is still a path to peace for us both. A series of negotiations for Karelia could yet find common ground and lay the groundwork for a new peace in the far North. If that is not amenable to the Finnish government, as a German politician once put it - bomb will be met by bomb."

The Romanians will no doubt think differently, but we have a range of options to neuter their defensive capabilities. A limited blockade would reduce the capabilities of the border army and perhaps pressure the Government to the negotiating table, but more subtle approaches like a gradual integration into our economic sphere and the lowering of tariffs could incentivise them to make a deal of their own free will. Our Red Army has the most ambitious plan of all - a full-blown coup by gradual infiltration of border cells behind Romanian lines."

We must instead seek the art of diplomatic concession to gain it, and that means granting the Romanian government a special relationship with us - to prove our sincerity we will offer an extravagant diplomatic treaty granting Romania ten year licenses on investments in our markets. After all, the strategic value of a mere port cannot possibly compare to the value of access to our resource extraction operations, can it?"

And we are more than capable of using armed coercive force to take what is ours, especially when the security of our Black Sea trade is at stake. That does not mean, however, that we will need to expend manpower on direct invasion. Embargoes have already been drafted, and the naval assets gathered, for the blockading of this strategic port; if we cannot have it, we will negate the trade value of this port for the Romanians until they see reason.

We will assuage doubts on the part of the Romanian government by allowing them equal access to oil, and more of it than they could possibly know what to do with. Joint-stock oil companies will be founded in the Romanian government's name, set loose in the Caucasus and be granted a blank cheque to expand as they will."

There is no real incentive to check them, and it would only be a bother for the guards to regulate their dimensions. It would come as no surprise, therefore, if large numbers of weapons and ammunition stores were to find themselves within some of these containers, and if they were then to make their way into the hands of the Socialist resistance in Odessa, would it not? After all, to suggest that we were behind the spontaneous increase in armed activity would be a direct insult to the Soviet Union."

The AZS, a broad-coalition of socialist aligned rebels, are ready to launch a coup - should they succeed, we have discreetly instructed them to sign a few documents forswearing ownership of a certain port. It is time to engage in a little direct democracy in Romania, and if we are lucky the chaos will grow to such an extent that the Odessan territory will be left unguarded entirely.

Our power plants must be connected with the major industrial areas of Russia to be of use, and these connections will consist of asphalt roads built to the specifications of large-scale traffic like lorries and trucks. Through this nexus of integrated roads, fuel supplies will be distributed according to a centralized schedule - this should prevent rolling brownouts in one area from crippling our economy and causing social chaos in the entire grid."

Yet to travel from one to the other takes at least a week of hard travel, and that is in the better half of the year - in the worse half, an explosion in Perm is more likely to be seen in Omsk than reported there in the next month. If this state of affairs continues, our electrification project will be dead before the first generator comes online. Thankfully, the attention of the Soviet state has ensured that our new High-Speed Road Project will be conducted with expediency: if it fails, half the Transport Ministry will...suddenly lose the will to continue in their current positions."

Access to this critical city could grant us access to these vast resource production regions, especially the oil-fields of Kazakhstan, but it will also allow us to extend the reach of our electricity grid to the far south.

The Germans have long stopped their expansions, however, and it is high time we rebuilt the old network linking both sides of the long mountains to connect them with our electric fuel network.

Industrial reactors, in particular, require drastic expansions across the cities of the Union to keep our civilian industry viable in the face of the institutional changes Chairman Orlov has promised. There are two concurrent ways of approaching this - one, of course, is to simply force a solution through massive building projects.

More importantly, it keeps us dependent on a select few areas of the old Union and Central Asia, and with German victory our access to these areas has become tenuous; it is an unending struggle to find fuel in sufficiency for our needs. If we are ever to break our dependence on this ponderous and unstable supply chain, we must find other means to power the Union - and Chairman Orlov believes the key to this lies in massive renewable energy facilities."

As the Great Depression wore off, however, the prodigious costs of these massive infrastructural projects soured public opinion on them everywhere in the world. But the Capitalist West does not dictate our infrastructural policy - Comrade-Chairman Orlov has decreed a blossoming of concrete upon our major rivers, and the flow of the waters of the land shall soon power the heart of the Nation itself!"

As we begin preliminary research into alternative energy sources, we will begin concurrent expansion of our existing electricity generators using more conventional fuel types. Some of these fuel types might make us more dependent on international capital, yes, and some might even leave us strategically vulnerable.

We must purge this stain from the Union at all costs, even if it means Vladivostok must be purged in a sea of blood to finish the job. And when we are done, and the last imperialist-opportunist is driven into the Pacific, we will raise the banner of Socialist Victory - and the world will tremble at its shadow."

SOV_zhukov_baltic_ssrs_desc:0 "Ostland is a state built on oppression as deep as the day is long, and we fully intend to uproot this system entirely. This will probably be a violent and chaotic process in itself, but the price of anti-imperialist activity has always been worth paying.

The Caucasus was the ancestral homeland of his family, and far-off Georgia is the perfect place to send this idiot son of Stalin to reflect on the practice of Socialism; hopefully this war will become such a protracted mess that Vasily dies a quiet death in his reminisces.

Very well - we shall give him a hero's reward! Rokossovsky shall lead the march to the Vistula, retaking Poland from the clutches of the vile collaborationists who have seized it from the Germans, and when he is done we shall install him there as our leader.

We value his immense contributions to the Liberation Struggle, so much so that we believe a retirement is best to allow him to rest from his exertions. This retirement will be enforced directly from High Command, and it will deliver him to the noble place of his birth; we will install a ceremonial position upon him and bar him from ever speaking out against the Leader again.

They will be too bankrupt to move, and too tired to flee - when they are worn down, they will naturalize to their superior agrarian environment.\n\nSome might call this ethnic cleansing.

We will also sponsor generous price-controls on farming equipment that should aid these brave farmers in making a life of their own.\n\nReports that this action will create more harm than good, and that small town Russians are totally inadequate to the harsh climatic conditions of actual farming, should be ignored entirely as counterrevolutionary behavior.

The time has come for an inherently Socialist approach to science to displace the bourgeois reified stupidity that is 'Darwinism'. That approach is Lysenkoism, which treats Soviet plants as the unflagging workers they truly are - and propels them ever upward through material stimulus, like exposure to cold or heat, to fertility and abundance.\n\nSome biologists have called this approach 'mad', even outright 'murderous', to our farmers.

It could yet prove our salvation now.\n\nBy adopting the city as our official standard bearer and implementing Magnitogorsk Model Projects across the Union, we shall enforce the same quotas, harsh work hours and intensive production practices that made the Steel City so effective.

We will begin retooling industrial workers in our cities for work in the countryside, build vast new facilities in concrete for them to work in the vast Ural plains, and attach them at strategic junctions in our road network to ease transportation costs.

Bukharin's championing of the New Economic Policy might have been popular in a time of immense crisis, and it certainly influenced its successor Kalininism, but his uprooting of Marxist doctrine endangered the nation's move to Socialism. Worse, the NEPmen who resell agricultural produce in the markets have become Bukharin's partners in crime, making a mockery of socialist equality! In the place of solidarity we have built a pigpen and called it Communism!\n\nNow that a new brand of Socialism is in vogue, it is time to destroy Bukharin's spectre, officially deplatforming his ideas of limited private industry.

This must change. If people do not truly believe in Socialism, all our central planning and welfare reforms are pointless, like painting the walls of an already burning house.\n\nWe have two broad directions, one orthodox, one, well, Orthodox, to choose between.

There have always been heroes - and now these Heroes will receive the recognition they so richly deserve.\n\nThe trick, of course, is to weave these cults of personality around a rich thread of Marxist theory.

Only bourgeois dissidents would claim that a lecture on the building of sound electrical systems cannot be leavened with a demonstration of the power of historical materialism. Indeed, who is to say that the material world does not operate by the same forces that drive Marxist analysis - power, struggle and class solidarity?\n\nThese ideas could give us room to expand the institutions of technical learning, and as ever, it will only come at the cost of a little curricular alteration."

After the temporary thaw in relations during the War, the priests that served Orthodox Russia were silenced, suppressed or generally forgotten about as the Union moved on to more pressing issues of survival. Our next move will surprise many - but it will surprise the forgotten Church most of all.\n\nChairman Zaytsev has decreed that the Church will be re-engineered to buffer the spirituality of the Soviet Soul. The recitation of Psalms, the giving of Communion and the highest sacred art of iconography are to receive lavish state attention. Senior statesmen will make going to Church fashionable again. All of this will only come at the cost of a few doctrinal modifications. Orthodoxy and Socialism will be welded together into a sword in the hands of the state, unbreakable, unbendable - undefeatable."
SOV_zaytsev_commune_churches:0 "Bring The Churches To The Communes"
SOV_zaytsev_commune_churches_desc:0 "For untold centuries Orthodox spirituality was the engine of Russian rural life. It demarcated the sacred from the profane, the festival from the riot, the beautiful from the damned. If we are ever to succeed in developing a truly Socialist Orthodoxy, we must turn this engine back on - and for this, too, Zaytsev has a plan.\n\nWe will officially incorporate the Orthodox Church into the workings of Soviet industry and agriculture, allowing their rituals to be conducted in conjunction with the affairs of state. Re-education of workers will take on explicitly religious overtones, priests will develop quotas on weekdays and souls on weekends, and churches themselves will now preach the Gospel of the Many rather than the Promise to a Few.\n\nReports of initial anger and rejection across the Church's autocephalous divisions are merely that, reports. When the system stabilizes, we are sure to succeed. Anyone who says otherwise had best watch their lips, lest the wrath of God be incurred."
SOV_zaytsev_church_of_lenin:0 "The Orthodox Church Of Lenin"
SOV_zaytsev_church_of_lenin_desc:0 "The centrepiece of Zaytsev's proposed reforms is the official elevation of Lenin to the status of Exalted Restorer of the Praxis-Faith - although Lenin was outwardly an avowed atheist to the day of his death, the Church shall now officially believe that his actions were inspired by the Pantocrator himself to build the Socialist Foundation of Orthodoxy. Just as Christ is two natures in one man, the true Church is both Christ-natured and Lenin-natured: two lungs through which the Church breathes secular and spiritual air.\n\nAccusations that this is nonsense, heresy and even outright insulting to the image of Christ shall be met with prompt defenses in the form of State-sanctioned heresy trials. We shall tolerate no insults to the work of the Exalted Restorer, nor shall we accept a breach of the Orthodox Church whose work he has secured for eternity!"
SOV_zaytsev_knights_transition:0 "The Knights' Transition"
SOV_zaytsev_knights_transition_desc:0 "The Knights of Lenin are a critical instrument of the state, no matter how much mockery they are shown by the apparatchiks. In the new Socialist order the Chairman envisions, they will keep the proletariat vigilant by guarding them against ideological threats - and the vanguard responsible, by acting as a buffer between them and the People. The Knights are our future, and now the contours of that future must be decided.\n\nThe main decision we must make is a simple one: will the Knights be a military organization or a civilian-dominated one? The power of the gun is not to be underestimated in influencing state-policy, but our ideological needs could arguably be served better by the adoption of Civilian Knights. In either case, much will need to be changed from the top down, as the Knights prepare to meld the ancient with the modern once again. No less than Russia itself is at stake."

SOV_zaytsev_warrior_knights_desc:0 "There is no better means to give power to the people than to ensure that their protectors bear heavy armaments. Lenin knew this, Marx knew this, and so do we. The Knights shall forever be military, their service determined on how well they serve the State as a paramilitary wing - and their ability to make their weapons useful to the People by destroying their enemies.\n\nThis also requires a substantial amount of retraining and logistics work, as our Red Army is unsurprisingly reluctant to cooperate with the Knights when it comes to giving up their precious arms to their peers. We will need to inflict heavy political pressure to ensure it happens, and conduct a little pre-emptive purging to smoothen the transition. Hopefully the rest of the Government will prove more cooperative..."

SOV_zaytsev_shifting_shock_infantry_desc:0 "Just as our Shock Armies disrupt enemy cohesion and tilt the battle in our favour before it begins, so too shall our Knights destroy the capability of all reactionary elements to resist us. There is an inherent congruence to their function. We shall formalize this congruence by merging the functions of the two groups: from now on, the Vanguard of the Vanguard shall serve the State in wartime and the People in peacetime, cross-training and mutually assisting each other.\n\nFrom a certain point of view, this could look like a coup of the Army's power base. It could even be said to be a transition into rule by paramilitary force. Those points of view are WRONG! The Knights' service shall be so exemplary that it will shut these dissenters up, if the State does not get its hands on them first!"
SOV_zaytsev_service_membership:0 "Membership Through Armed Service"
SOV_zaytsev_service_membership_desc:0 "To formalise the hierarchy of the Knights along military lines, it will be necessary to make the Knights themselves work in military roles. How can an organization enforce discipline in the People if it does not first learn discipline itself? The Knights will therefore be formally inserted into the Red Army, with a period of national service as a prerequisite for joining. Thanks to our earlier merger of the Knights with the Shock Infantry, we are confident that they will serve with merit in any number of infantry roles!\n\nJust in case the Red Army does not get the message and, ah, read the room, we will also ensure the Knights will be disproportionately hired for political-officers to keep the soldiers in line. It would be very, very unwise for these loyal, radical elements to get wind of possible dissent or conspiracy in the ranks. Very unwise indeed."

Their roles are simple: they will conduct regular ideological sessions and inspire the masses to excel in their work for the Revolution, while also conducting administrative work in tandem with the authorities.\n\nWith the Knights' dedication to serving the People undimmed, they will identify potential troublemakers within our administration itself, honing the State like a sharp knife.

In some places the Knights have formed battalions that act as work brigades, which is commendable, but in others there is not even a squad's worth of them. This must be rectified.\n\nTo even out the numbers, we will assist the Knights in asserting presence in urban and rural population centres. Our existing cadres will be encouraged to actively seek out the Knights and make every effort to cooperate with them - rejection will be taken as proof of disloyalty and treated as such. Soon, the whole of Russian society will be infused with the essence of revolutionary idealism, and the world will tremble at the results."

They will spend their lives removed from distraction, from the seduction of bourgeois decadence, and they will live as examples of the Socialist ideal - they will ascend from mere men to icons of the Immortal Science.

The secret police will also bring expertise to some of the surveillance operations the Knights have been conducting in areas of suspected cryptofascist activity, and an endless appetite for, ah, revolutionary violence.\n\nWe understand that this will be a controversial move, even an unpopular one, within the Knights. They, more than anyone else, must understand that sacrifices must be made for the Revolution.

Even total pseudo-science, such as psychokinetics, are experimented on and gain funding and resources from an obsessed Konev.\n\nThe experiments are only just beginning, and their usefulness to Soviet society or the Soviet army is extremely questionable, but they will nonetheless be a key feature of Konev's dark agenda going forwards, performed in secret locations dotted around Central Asia and Siberia..."

Now, with Konev's strengthening of internal travel restrictions and setting up of more checkpoints, travel within the territories of the Soviet Union has been even further restricted. Internal passports and other documentation are required at all times, and most people are not permitted to travel beyond their hometown without a very good reason.\n\nBy restricting the people's movements, their every action becomes more coordinated and organised within the Soviet state."

Yet there is little beyond that of a 'trial' to speak of. All the necessary 'evidence' has already been collected, poured over, and the verdict is the same and a non-question.

It is this faction that, after much preparation, has become the latest target of Bulganin's brutal purges. In a long-planned and well-coordinated action, Bulganin supporters within the NKVD were rapidly arrested with brutal efficiency across the Soviet territories.

For once, there is no need for crimes to be made up or even exaggerated, the \"defendant\" has committed crimes against the Soviet people that are very real and can be attested by all. The scale of the crimes is still impossible to fully verify due to the thorough and near total destruction of eastern Europe, but it is clear they go unmatched in all of history.\n\nAs the trials come to an end after a very quick period of deliberation by the judges, the harshest sentence was given to Germany as a whole in absentia, many in the Soviet Union for once agree that in this circumstance, Konev's cruelty may be warranted."

As expected by anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of basic science, these experiments yielded no results in their aim, and all attempts to create telekenesis have failed.\n\nOn the other hand, with experimental subjects being severely traumatised and disturbed by the concoction of drugs and horrific processes they were exposed to during the experiments, the tests have yielded an accidental success.

twrsovzhukov.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union's most decorated and successful military commander, Marshal Georgy Zhukov, has secured his leadership of the remnants of the Soviet Union and been made Premier in Perm. One of the few Soviet commanders to repeatedly succeed in battles against the German invaders in the Nazi-Soviet war, to many it was clear that, despite not being the favourite of the powerful NKVD, Zhukov would rise to ultimate power over what was left of the Union. From now on, it will be this man's vision that will drive the Soviet Union forwards, and he is dead-set on reunifying the nation, smashing the Nazi menace and liberating territories that have been torn away."
twrsovzhukov.1.a:0 "Hail to the Grand Marshal!"
twrsovzhukov.2.t:0 "Victory at the Volkshalle"
twrsovzhukov.2.d:0 "With our forces victorious over the Germans, the Volkshalle, at the center of Berlin, is under our control. As a testament to our final victory over Nazism and the German menace, it will become an unofficial 'eternal embassy', an undying symbol of the final triumph of Russia, the Soviet Union and Socialism over the dark forces of ultra-reactionarism."
twrsovzhukov.2.a:0 "A Final Victory!"
twrsovzhukov.3.t:0 "Death of Zhukov"
twrsovzhukov.3.d:0 "Tragedy! In an ironic twist of fate, our great Marshal and leader Georgy Zhukov has died on a visit to the newly seized German capital. On a visit to Germania, formerly known as Berlin, a collapse of part the badly damaged Volskhalle crushed and killed several people during an inspection of the building, including Marshal Zhukov himself. There are rumours circling of foul play, but for now, it is being considered an extremely tragic and unfortunate accident.\n\nWith such a sudden and unexpected power vacuum, the Politburo has been thrown into     and wrangling, as leading figures in Zhukov's government wrestle for power. It remains to be seen who will come out on top."
twrsovzhukov.3.a:0 "The great Marshal passes"
twrsovzhukov.4.t:0 "The Successor"
twrsovzhukov.4.d:0 "As the Soviet people still mourn the passing of their greatest leader since Lenin, the power struggle within the echelons of leadership continue. The late Zhukov's cabinet and other officials engage in political manouvring to gain power over the rebuilt Soviet Union. One of them will win the contest for power, which one will it be?"
