 TWR_Mohammed:0 "Mohammad Al-Khamis Ben Youssef Ben Mohammed Al-Alaoui or Mohammed V has been the come and gone ruler of the Morrocan people for close to 30 years now. Repressed to a small figurehead by the French after the occupation of Morroco, the Sultan of Morocco returned to his homeland after the fall of the French and the restablishment of the Kingdom of Morroco under the administration of the Spanish. Constantly pushed by the Spanish to become an integrated Spanish state, Mohammed remains the benevolent leader he was from the start, providing for his people and the persecuted Jews of Europe, allowing them asylum from the horrors of the Nazi Government of Germany. Leader of the Morocco, his people have grown tired of the Spanish boot over them. His leadership may bring forward a truly independent Morocco."
