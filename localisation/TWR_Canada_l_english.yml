#### Focuses ####
CAN_Army_Start:0 "캐나다 국군"
CAN_Army_Start_desc:0 "The Royal Canadian Army is the army branch of our armed forces. Having distinguished itself in the Great War, the wars of the 1940s and other conflicts around the world, it's imperative that we continue to update our forces for the uncertain future that awaits us."
CAN_Army_Offensive:0 "캐나다의 공세"
CAN_Army_Offensive_desc:0 "독립적이고 존경받는 국가로서 우리는 하나같이 행동하기 시작해야 합니다. 토론토 협약의 우리의 용감한 동맹국들과 함께, 우리는 모든 곳의 억압받는 사람들의 해변과 거리에서 주도권을 잡을 것입니다!"
CAN_Army_C_Force:0 "'C' 포스의 유산"
CAN_Army_C_Force_desc:0 "The C Force were amongst the first Canadian troops to see action in the war against Japan, valiantly defending the city of Hong Kong. In a tragic set of circumstances, this ragtag battalion of undertrained and under-equipped men were overrun and slaughtered. We must learn from this mistake, and our high command recommends further professionalization and logistical reforms."
CAN_Army_ExpForce:0 "캐나다 원정군 강화"
CAN_Army_ExpForce_desc:0 "On deployment to other parts of the world, Canadian Expeditionary Forces provide the backbone of our contribution to allied efforts. Our forces should be prepared for more future overseas deploymants so they have the necessary fighting ability and logistical infrastructure to hold their own."
CAN_Army_Scheme_One:0 "국방계획 수정 #1"
CAN_Army_Scheme_One_desc:0 "The original Defence Scheme 1 was a war plan in the event of an American invasion, meant to delay an invading force as long as possible until British assistance arrives. This is no longer relevant for the current geopolitical situation, as America is a close ally and Canada's greatest threat now lies across the ocean in the form of totalitarian Nazism. This war plan should be modified to hold off an invading force on our eastern seaboard for as long as possible until American assistance arrives."
CAN_Army_Vimy:0 "비미의 유령"
CAN_Army_Vimy_desc:0 "We had gone into the Great War as British North Americans, but we left it as Canadians. We will never forget the brave lives that were lost in the trenches of northern France, and the legacy of their great sacrifices will continue to shape our message of national unity and cooperation for years to come!"
CAN_Army_Rangers:0 "현대화된 캐나다 레인저"
CAN_Army_Rangers_desc:0 "The Canadian Rangers are among the most prestigious of our armed forces, acting primarily as dispersed scouts that can live off the land and engage in guerrilla tactics if needed. Bringing this elite force into the modern age with new equipment and training will bring nothing but gains for our new army."
CAN_Army_Defense:0 "국토 방공망 강화"
CAN_Army_Defense_desc:0 ""
CAN_Army_Warning:0 "초기 경고선 구축"
CAN_Army_Warning_desc:0 ""
CAN_Army_VetGuard:0 "베테랑 가드 강화"
CAN_Army_VetGuard_desc:0 "We've many battle-hardened veterans from the war in Japan, veterans we can learn a great deal from. By bringing these experienced men back into the army as advisors, we can improve on the tactics of old."

CAN_Army_MCL_desc:0 ""
CAN_Retire_Lee_Enfield:0 "리엔필드 은퇴"
CAN_Retire_Lee_Enfield_desc:0 "The Lee-Enfield rifle has served our army and other commonwealth nations well over the years, but frankly, it's outdated. While it is a reliable bolt-action rifle, that alone won't do with the nature of modern warfare. We will have to sideline the rifle in favour of more modern assault rifles."
CAN_Copy_American_Tanks:0 "미국 탱크 설계도 복사"
CAN_Copy_American_Tanks_desc:0 "Our southern neighbours are the foremost expert in armoured warfare in the entire Toronto Accord, an opportunity we'd be fools to pass up on. We should get in contact with the American army high command and request the blueprints of tanks used in their fearsome armoured brigades, so that we can build them here in Canada."
CAN_Grizzlies:0 "현대화된 그리즐리스"
CAN_Grizzlies_desc:0 "The Grizzly is our primary medium tank, a modified M4A1 design taken from the Americans during the last war. With Canada's military role expanding out to international conflicts more than ever before, we need more than just a battle tank. By creating an armoured personnel carrier under the same name, we can expand the range and utility of our motorized brigades to outmaneuver the enemy in terrain that tanks would never dare lay their tracks in."
CAN_Health_Services:0 "건강 서비스 그룹"
CAN_Health_Services_desc:0 "The role of the field hospital on a battlefield is just as important if not more so than the role of the generals laying out battle plans. By operating on and saving the lives of our brave soldiers injured in battle, they can go and fight another day. Field medics and army surgeons have mostly been integrated into the army directly in the past, but such an important role can't be sidelined any longer. By creating the Canadian Army Health Services Group, we can set up mobile field hospitals close to the front lines and save lives in a timely and efficient manner."
CAN_British_Arms:0 "영국 무기 구매"
CAN_British_Arms_desc:0 "As the temperature in Europe and elsewhere continues to rise, the call for rearmament rises. Part of the military budget should then go to purchasing arms from our longest-running suppliers, the British. It would be shameful if we could not provide a gun for every recruit, after all."
CAN_Vigilamus_Pro_Te:0 "비질라무스 프로 테"
CAN_Vigilamus_Pro_Te_desc:0 "Canada is our home and native land, and our army, the finest in the world, shall stand on guard for it. At home and abroad, the Canadian soldier is respected as not only a highly disciplined weapon of war, but a benevolent keeper of peace. With God's grace, the future will be very bright for our brave men and women fighting in the cause of upholding the ideas of freedom both at home and abroad."

CAN_Navy_Start:0 "캐나다 왕립 해군"
CAN_Navy_Start_desc:0 "The royal canadian navy: The navy is an extremely vital branch of the armed forces, projecting our seas and aiding our allies abroad in wartime. Its importance cannot be understated, so perhaps we should look into refitting it."
CAN_Navy_Reserves:0 "예비선박 검토"
CAN_Navy_Reserves_desc:0 "The Reserve Navy is a relic of the past, to say the least. A significant portion of the fleet are old and outdated rusted trash heaps. We should review the performance of every ship in the fleet and begin plans for modernizing them, lest we fall behind the rest of the world."
CAN_Navy_Helicopters:0 "선박용 헬리콥터 도입"
CAN_Navy_Helicopters_desc:0 "Chief Admiral Harry Dewolf has come up with a brilliant suggestion in how to further utilize the capability of the fleet. These so-called "helicopters" can take off and land on the platforms of an aircraft carrier and not take as much space as reconaissance planes. He suggests the implementation of highly skilled helicopter crews to be integrated into the navy for the purpose of improving reconnaissance in combat situations. How can we possibly turn such a brilliant man's plan down?"
CAN_Navy_Bombers:0 "해군 폭격기"
CAN_Navy_Bombers_desc:0 "Our naval observers have keenly noted what did and did not work in the last war, and one particularly noteworthy point was the value of naval bombers. Being able to drop an explosive payload onto enemy ships with terrifying accuracy, they had become especially useful in the Pacific War against Japan. We should implement modernized naval bombers to work for the navy, to further increase its combat effectiveness."
CAN_Navy_Destroyers:0 "세인트 로랑 구축함 소개"
CAN_Navy_Destroyers_desc:0 "The destroyer is probably the most important of all ships in a modern navy. While it can pack a small but significant punch in direct conflicts with other ships, it is perhaps most valuable in the realm of maritime interdiction. Given the current naval capabilities of nations who remain hostile towards democracy, the need to create a new class of destroyers to better deal with a new age of naval warfare is clear."
CAN_Navy_Production:0 "조선소 확장"
CAN_Navy_Production_desc:0 "There is a growing call for rearmament amongst many of our politicians, as other parts of the world may find themselves in conflicts that may require our involvement. To this end, a naval rearmament program will begin effective immediately to further increase the size of our navy."
CAN_Navy_Carrier:0 "항공모함 구입"
CAN_Navy_Carrier_desc:0 "Canada has over the past couple of years experienced incredible economic growth coming out of the great depression and subsequent wars. Our allies in the meantime have difficulty making ends meet due to internal issues, especially our good friends in London. We should ask to purchase one of their older aircraft carriers so that we may grow our fleet further, and to alleviate the economic woes of a Toronto Accord ally."
CAN_Navy_ASW:0 "대잠전의 새로운 시대"
CAN_Navy_ASW_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine; the name alone had captivated the attention and fear of the west during the last war. But what we learned from the conflict was how important the protection of shipping was against predatory U-Boats. We should review our last conflict with the German navy, for if (or perhaps, when) another war breaks out, we stand prepared having learned from our mistakes."
CAN_Navy_Interdiction:0 "새로운 시대를 위한 해양 차단"
CAN_Navy_Interdiction_desc:0 "The doctrine of maritime interdiction has served the navy well for the past couple years, however many of our tactics might also not be up to speed with modern ships. Canadians have learned all too well in 1914 what going into a conflict with an outdated mindset can do, and would not want such a tragic mistake to ever happen again. We must evaluate the strategic planning capabilities of our finest officers and bring them to the modern age."
CAN_Navy_Final:0 "파라티 베로 파라티"
CAN_Navy_Final_desc:0 "The Canadian Royal Navy stands as a moving force in the world, able to stand alongside other champions of democracy and fight valiantly in its noble cause. Ready Aye Ready is our motto, and by the grace of God almighty we shall be!"

CAN_Air_Start:0 "캐나다 왕립 공군"
CAN_Air_Start_desc:0 "The air force is an important and prestigious branch of our armed forces, having distinguished itself in the last war. We should begin preparing it for the next one, so we may fly as equals alongside our allies once again."
CAN_Air_Coordination:0 "조직화된 전장"
CAN_Air_Coordination_desc:0 "The German blitzkrieg across Europe stunned army commanders across the world with its speed and devastating effectiveness, having conquered Europe from France to Arkhangelsk. What we've learned from this war was the importance of air superiority is that direct assistance in ground combat is extremely effective. We should adapt this into the general air force stratagem."
CAN_Air_Paratroopers:0 "공수부대 현대화"
CAN_Air_Paratroopers_desc:0 "Our paratroopers are nothing short of an incredibly brave and esteemed branch of the air force, able to operate far behind enemy lines and take important objectives against the odds. We should train our paratroopers in the art of modern warfare for the wars to come."
CAN_Air_Blitz:0 "공세로부터의 교훈"
CAN_Air_Blitz_desc:0 "The RCAF briefly participated in skirmishes in Europe alongside our English friends, a brief but enlightening experience. Although it ended up being for little as we were forced to sign an armistice with the Germans, our air crews learned a great deal in the world of dogfighting. We should take the lessons learned from the fights that we won and lost, lest we be forced to sign yet another humiliating treaty with the enemy."
CAN_Air_Canadair:0 "캐나디어 의뢰"
CAN_Air_Canadair_desc:0 "Canadair is the foremost aircraft manufacturer in Canada, an extremely wealthy and talented company that we've come to rely on over the years. We must now call on them again, this time to commission a new class of transport planes. Our air force high command predicts that any future conflict could see them becoming extremely useful in civil and military applications alike, there's nothing to lose by throwing money at an all-Canadian company to design truly Canadian aircraft."
CAN_Air_TA:0 "토론토 협약 항공 훈련 계획"
CAN_Air_TA_desc:0 "The government has an ingenious plan to strengthen the Toronto Accord alliance while improving the capabilities of the air force; an inter-alliance training program aimed at training pilots from across the alliance on the finest grounds of them all, right here at home. If they accept, it'll be beneficial for all. "
CAN_Air_Home_Defense:0 "국토 방공망 강화"
CAN_Air_Home_Defense_desc:0 "The home defence is important for Canada's security, and we must be ready for any threat that may come our way. Herr Goering mocks us by claiming the Luftwaffe can reach as far as Toronto, but we can prove him wrong. By improving our response capabilities to incoming threats from the air, not one plane will reach our fair domain!"
CAN_Air_Final:0 "페르 아르두아 아드 아스트라"
CAN_Air_Final_desc:0 "To the stars! That is the motto of our airforce. Through adversity, the great fighters of Canada rule the skies like no other nation does. The stars look kindly down on our brave fighters, just as the gods of old once did. The Royal Canadian Air Force is like no other in the world, come shall what may!"

CAN_Start_Liberal_Focus_1_desc:0 "The title of governor-general is largely ceremonial, meant to act as the British monarch’s representative to the royal subjects of Canada. This task has never been undertaken by a Canadian however, and with the changing political climate this has to change. The prime minister will petition London to give our growing nation it’s first Canadian governor-general, to further assert our role in the Commonwealth and the world. "
CAN_Start_Liberal_Focus_2_desc:0 "The Supreme Court is considered to be the highest branch of law in any modern nation-state. Ideally, it is to be impartial in how it upholds the laws we hold so dearly in a democratic society. Unfortunately, it is largely powerless; as litigants in cases can choose to appeal at the Judicial Privy Council situated in London instead. Canada must no longer have people in other countries dictate the most sacred of our institutions, and the Supreme Court of Canada will be made the utmost highest legal authority in our fair domain. "
CAN_Start_Liberal_Focus_3_desc:0 "\"Help those who cannot help themselves.\" This was the famous motto coined by the late prime minister Mackenzie King to create a better Canada for the less-fortunate. Upon succeeding this titan of our times, Louis St. Laurent has promised to continue his legacy through sweeping social welfare reforms. With elections just around the corner, it would be most prudent to extend these reforms to creating a universal pension plan so that our seniors can live out their golden years in happiness instead of anxiety. "
CAN_Start_Starting_Focus_desc:0 "캐나다는 오랫동안 번영한 민주주의 국가였다. 미래가 어떻게 될지 누가 알겠는가?"
CAN_Start_1952_Quebec_Elections_desc:0 "Our attention now turns to the ever-tumultuous Francophone province of Quebec, famous for opposing conscription and their increased demands for rights and equality in Canada. The candidates in the 1952 Quebec elections are certainly colourful folks; the regionalist Union Nationale on the right and the incumbent Liberal Party. Although both sides oppose conscription, the Union Nationale under its leadership of Maurice Duplessis is openly catholic and anticommunist. Should \"Le Chef\" win and shake up the status quo, Quebec may once again be thrown into turmoil."
CAN_Start_1952_Duplessis_desc:0 "Ending Adelard Godbout's eight year premiership, Maurice Duplessis is once again in charge of the Francophone province of Quebec. With the "Grand Noirceur" once again in action, many left wing and liberal groups in Quebec worry that his new term will bring the province into another Great Darkness favouring conservatism over progressivism. But only time will tell what Le Chef's new term will bring."
CAN_Start_1952_Godbout_desc:0 "Having been defeated at the polls once again, Maurice Duplessis has meekly accepted the re-election of Adelard Godbout as Premier of Quebec. Running on a platform of peaceful cooperation with Ottawa and economic/social liberalism, Godbout is expected to continue his previous term's policy of helping Quebec transition to a secular and modernized province in Canada. "
CAN_Start_Union_Crackdown_desc:0 "Premier Duplessis knows that unions are nothing but tools of the communists, used to infiltrate and destroy our great nation, and as such, has ordered a crackdown."
CAN_Start_General_Strike_desc:0 "It appears that many workers do not appreciate being saved from communism, and a general strike has broken out. Premier Duplessis knows that this is nothing but the beginning of a communist revolution against our great nation, and has requested that the PM deploy the army to crush the strike."
CAN_Start_Next_Elections_desc:0 "These next elections will be historic, as global events push Canada’s role as a champion of democracy on par with its strongest allies. The roles of all the establishment parties and the minority populists in parliament are sure to make our position in the next four years an interesting one. All that’s left now is for the next prime minister to be selected by the people themselves. "
CAN_Start_Quiet_Revolution_desc:0 "For years, Quebec premier Adélard Godbout has been radically transforming the Francophone province towards a progressive and liberal future. Being dubbed by outsiders as the “Quiet Revolution”, his unique style of politicking must be continued to bring the province out from the dark ages of Clerical Supremacy reinforced by former-premier Maurice Duplessis."
CAN_Start_Conscription_Deal_desc:0 "History has shown that the Québécois peoples want little to do with what they see as not their wars. As Ottawa appears to act in the interests of the Toronto Accord, most Quebecers are content with a stance of neutrality. If the prime minister can sit down with the anti-conscription premier of Quebec and reach even the slightest compromise, Canada has nothing to lose and everything to gain."

CAN_Oil_Nukes:0 "가마솥 프로젝트"
CAN_Oil_Nukes_desc:0 "American geologists have been trying to find peaceful applications for nuclear energy in the noble cause of peaceful development, however one L.M Latland has proposed a more... radical application. Using American nuclear warheads, underground nuclear detonations would (at least in theory) boil the oil sand deposits so regular methods of oil extraction could be used. Although the thought of using destructive weapons at all is unpalatable to some politicians, the benefits surely outweigh one or two angry politicians..."
CAN_Nuclear_Program_1:0 "캐나다의 원자력 프로젝트"
CAN_Nuclear_Program_1_desc:0 "Diplomacy is, unfortunately, not the solution in dealing with totalitarian states. Should they threaten our existence and very way of life, we must be ready. Many of our finest scientists worked with America on the atomic bomb project, and could theoretically apply our growing nuclear industry for military applications. Deterrence is the greatest tool for preserving peace, is it not?"

CAN_LDR_DREW_DESC:0 "Born and raised in northern Ontario, George Drew studied law shortly before becoming a distinguished officer in the First World War. Becoming a Colonel by the end of the war, Drew was elected mayor of his hometown of Guelph and became an important politician in the Ontario Conservative Party. Climbing through the party ranks first as Premier of Ontario and then leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, Drew became infamous for his red baiting campaigns against CCF politicians and for his inflammatory remarks towards French Canadians. Now against the odds, Drew has been elected as Prime Minister. Will he be able to repair his relationship with Canada's francophone population and bring Canada into a new age after decades of Liberal rule?"
CAN_LDR_DIEF_DESC:0 "Born in Western Ontario, John Diefenbaker was raised in the prairies of the Northwestern Territories. His political ambitions began at a young age,but were never taken seriously by his family. After serving in the First World War, Diefenbaker entered a legal career which soon became a political one. He became one of the leading lights in the local Conservative Party,in a traditionally Liberal region, and became known as a vocal opponent of free trade with the United States- fearing American domination over Canada. Now his hard work has finally paid off- his political successes have led to him becoming Prime Minister. Will he cave in to the mainstream, or will he break American dominance?"
CAN_LDR_LAURENT_DESC:0 "Louis Stephen St. Laurent was born in a Quebec village to bilingual parents. During his time as an accomplished lawyer in Quebec, he became a staunch supporter of the Liberal Party and enamoured with the late politician Wilfrid Laurier. Eventually entering politics in 1941 as a member of Mackenzie King's cabinet as Minister of Justice and later as Minister of External Affairs, he helped gather the nations of the free world into the Toronto Accord; putting Canada on the map in the post-war world. After being selected as leader of the Liberal Party after Mackenzie King's retirement to overwhelming support, he created Canada's first mass-media figure in politics leading him to win a comfortable majority government in 1949 as prime minister. Not hiding his disdain for the authoritarian regimes that now dominate mainland Europe as well as a distaste for communism, St. Laurent is determined to strengthen Canada's position in the world while upholding the ideas of political liberty and internal unity."
CAN_LDR_PEARSON_DESC:0 "Born and raised in Toronto, Lester Pearson graduated from college with an affinity for sociology and history. A distinguished officer during the First World War, Pearson was largely unsure with what to do with his life. Passing the foreign service exam with flying colours, he would enter a career in international politics. Becoming First Secretary of the Canadian High Commission in London in 1935, Pearson's career in foreign affairs became an extremely accomplished one. Becoming Canada's ambassador to the United States in 1945 and later Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1946, Pearson became an extremely influential Liberal politician; being instrumental in the formation of the Toronto Accord. Now as he stands as Prime Minister of Canada, Pearson is an adamant supporter of strengthening Canada's position in the Accord and continuing his predecessor's work of improving the welfare for all Canadians."
CAN_LDR_DOUGLAS_DESC:0 "Thomas Clement Douglas was born in Scotland to a relatively poor family, moving to Winnipeg in 1910. During his childhood, Tommy had become convinced that healthcare should be made free for all after he was treated for a traumatic illness that would've amputated his leg if his family had to pay for the expenses. Witnessing the RCMP kill one of the demonstrators during the Winnipeg General Strike of 1918 firsthand, he became convinced of the need to uphold universal freedoms for all citizens. Studying sociology, theology and socialist economics in university, he later moved to Saskatchewan as a church minister. Joining the CCF on its foundation, he quickly moved through its ranks and became the first democratic socialist premier in Canada; introducing medicare to the province of Saskatchewan. Becoming a popular MP in the House of Commons and later a cabinet minister in the new CCF-lead government, Tommy Douglas has now become Prime Minister. But will he be able to bring his grandiose ideas of nation-wide medicare and universal rights to all Canadians?"
CAN_LDR_LEWIS_DESC:0 "Born as David Losz to Polish Jewish parents, David was exposed from an early age to members of the Jewish Labour Bund; a secular Jewish party that worked in the Russian Empire advocating for socialist policies and the deposition of the Russian Tzar. Leaving for Canada with his family in 1921 to escape the Polish-Soviet war, David Lewis began to work with socialist organizations in Montreal and Nova Scotia. Moving to Great Britain to study law at Lincoln College, Lewis associated himself with multiple socialist circles on campus; frequently getting into fights with BUF Blackshirts. Although Lewis is a vocal anticommunist as per the norm with Bundist thought, his political views are frequently viewed as \"Parliamentary Marxism\". Rejecting an offer to join the British Labour Party and returning to Canada, Lewis became the National Secretary of the CCF in 1935. Believing in forging ties with the country's largest unions, Lewis advocates for a mixed economy in times of peace; citing the success of Mackenzie King's centralized economic planning during the Second World War. Now that he is the leader of the CCF and Canada's first Jewish Prime Minister, will he be able to continue his plans of combatting communist influence and realize the CCF's dreams?"
CAN_LDR_COLDWELL_DESC:0 "Born and raised in England, Major Coldwell moved to Canada when he was 22 to become a teacher in Alberta and later on in Saskatchewan. Creating the Farmer-Labour Party in 1929, Coldwell began making connections within labour and farmer's organizations in the prairies. Becoming the first national secretary of the CCF in 1934, Coldwell regularly clashed with other CCF politicians over Canada's involvement in the Second World War, believing in intervention against the Axis over pacifism. Becoming leader of the CCF in 1942 after J.S. Woodsworth's death, Coldwell continues to uphold the democratic socialist policies on which the party was founded despite fierce red baiting from his Liberal and Tory opponents. Convinced on the need to either abolish capitalism or reform it in Canada, Coldwell's election as North America's first democratic socialist leader has undoubtedly shaken the mainstream political establishment to its core. But will he be able to overcome resistance from the opposition and within his party?"

twrcanada.20.d:0 "For decades, the Dominion of Canada has used the Canadian Red Ensign as its official flag. While it remains popular with most prominent conservatives, many in the Liberal and CCF camps have been calling for a national referendum to decide on a new flag as Canada drifts further away from its colonial past. Citing the changing times of which Canada has an important role in as well as the need to bridge the divide between the French Canadians and Ottawa for a united Confederation, three proposals for Canada's flag have been brought forth to the Prime Minister. The first flag, the so-called "Pearson Pennant" had been drafted by the prominent Liberal politician Lester Pearson; joining three red maple leafs onto one stem occupying a white field, with blue bars on the side. The second flag was created by prominent Canadian historian George Stanley; calling for a simple and recognizable flag, he proposes a single red maple leaf on a white background with red bars on the side. With all three flags (as well as the current Red Ensign) in hand, the referendum goes ahead as planned despite strong Conservative opposition. With the votes counted late into the night, the results are..."

A vague series of legislations that prevent the \"infiltration of communist propaganda in the province of Quebec\", it's been regularly used by the provincial government to crack down on those advocating for the rights of workers (or those that oppose Duplessis' Laissez Faire economics). After securing his re-election, the premier has announced an amendment to the anti-communist legislation; the government's Labour Relations Commission will be authorized to withdraw union certification from any union that it finds guilty of "communist activities". On par with his usual rhetoric, many top union leaders have already strongly condemned the proposed law, accusing him of simply making up a reason to remove his opposition. "

On the strong urging of St. Laurent himself, the premier has agreed to send Union Nationale representatives to sit down with the provincial unions to talk about ending the strike; with federally-sponsored mediators of course. After hours of rather tense negotiations, the Duplessis government has announced an agreement that would bring an end to the strike while also keeping communist sympathizers away from the unions.

[CONSERVATIVE LEADER] went on a fiery tangent on the Liberal's seeming lack of care for the basic right of assembly, going as far as to call Capitol Hill "Little Germania".

In his passionate speech, he vehemently condemned the Liberal Government for letting the \"proto-Hitlerite" Duplessis\" have his way in crushing the rights of Quebec's working class. Going further in his speech, he accused St. Laurent of acting in the interests of large businesses over the common Canadian people. Upon ending his speech, he was received with a passionate roar from the crowd, later singing the song of the C.C.F.

He has declared that it is time for the Canadian people to throw off the shackles of monarchism and become a republic. This move has been met with strong condemnation by the Tories, who, as usual, are claiming that we intend to transform Canada into a communist dictatorship.

twrcanada_ccf.6.d:0 "Prime Minister Major Coldwell was unexpectedly called in for a cabinet meeting to "deal with the future of the CCF" this morning. Walking into the meeting, he was greeted only by Hazen Argue, Tommy Douglas and David Lewis; Mr. Coldwell's most trusted MPs. Being accused of being an dangerous extremist attempting to hand Canada over to the communists, Argue has demanded that Coldwell resign as Prime Minister amidst the republican crisis. Reluctantly agreeing to resign in favour of a more moderate politician, this leaves the CCF with two options for a new leader and Prime Minister of Canada. Our first option is Tommy Douglas, a Saskatchewan reverend who brought sweeping social welfare reforms to the province in North America's first democratic socialist government extremely popular throughout the country. Our other option is David Lewis, a powerful democratic socialist MP known for advocating Bundist politics and nationalized economic planning. Ultimately, the new choice for Prime Minister is..."

While the CCF majority ensured the bill would pass, our government has faced stark criticism from Liberals and Tories alike, with the Tories slamming the government with accusations that we intend to turn Canada into a 'communist dictatorship' while the Liberals are angry that we did not bother to hold a referendum before moving ahead with this.

At precisely 0630 hours Ottawa time, local residents awoke to something they never thought they'd ever see in Canada. Tanks rolled onto Parliament Hill with troops accompanying them.

This morning, three Canadian army divisions marched into the country's capital in an unexpected move to force the new government to resign, under the pretext of \"restoring order\" and \"saving Canada from the Bolshevik menace\". Similar events had taken place across the country. Prime Minister Coldwell authorized the RCMP to move in and disperse the attempted coup, by force if necessary. It was clear that the coup wasn't well planned out, as the RCMP managed to route the rebellious generals. While the remainder of the army appears to remain loyal and commerce centres remain mostly intact, it's evident to Coldwell and the CCF that the old order is a threat to the livelihood of the Canadian worker, and more radical reforms are already being drafted. Officially, the Toronto Accord denies all involvements, but some believe otherwise..."

Similar events had taken place across the country. Prime Minister Coldwell, under pressure from his cabinet have chosen to resign to prevent what they believe would become civil war. Upon leaving Parliament Hill, the CCF ministers were promptly arrested by MPs to the background of jeering soldiers. With the Tories returning to Parliament Hill by request of the local brigadier general, it's certain that the new government set up in the coup's wake will be dominated by the Conservatives. Foreign observers now expect the new Tory government to be more authoritarian in nature as it snuffs out the nation's perceived enemies so that \"the reds will never again rear their ugly head\""

After centuries of living under 'Anglo' rule, the French Canadians of Quebec have been granted independence. Citing a complete disregard for their interests and the threat of anglification, an independence referendum has passed under Ottawa's watchful eye. While nationalists parade through the streets of Montreal and Quebec City, the remainder of Canada now sits uneasy as a founding province in its confederation and a hallmark of Canadian identity slips away to pursue its own destiny."

Following days of unrest in the Francophone city of Montreal over increasingly draconian anti-union laws, the Canadian military has been called in on Premier Duplessis' request to put down what he called "communist banditry". Killing 12 and injuring 50, the move has made both the Quebec and Ottawa governments extremely unpopular across the country. As nationwide demonstrations venerating the strikers march in every city, many Québécois politicians are abandoning the established regionalist parties to take a radical sovereigntist stance. After a formal apology condemning Duplessis' actions has been made by the prime minister's office, it's becoming clear that St. Laurent's government won't last very long now."

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has been experimenting with television broadcasts over the years as the new technology has become more readily available, and now first the time a 24/7 broadcasting station has been put in business. Running as two separate entities (CBFT and CBLT for French and English programming respectively) the launch was a stunning success. Following a brief message from Prime Minister Laurent greeting the Canadian people over TV for the first time, both stations went ahead with their own programs. While the French station played a translated version of "Aladdin And His Lamp", the English channel played a wonderful rendition of the Leslie Bell Singers. Already, people across the country are clamouring for television sets when the Hockey Night in Canada radio program announced its first television broadcast in late October. This profound achievement marks a new chapter in Canadian culture."

twrcanada.7.d:0 "The past couple days have been tumultuous in the ever-dramatic world of Canadian hockey, but the latest scandal now has current politics thrown into the beloved sport. Star winger of the Montreal Canadiens and Quebecois celebrity Maurice Richard hit a linesman during a fight over an offside call during a game. As a disciplinary action, Richard has been suspended for the rest of the NHL's 1955 season. Believing his punishment to be too severe, Canadiens fans across Montreal took to the streets demanding some leniency for Richard. With the knowledge that the NHL president is an anglo Canadian, these protests took a nationalistic turn when fans accused the NHL for discrimination based on Maurice Richard's Francophone heritage.\n\nFollowing an extremely tense Canadiens game of which the president was in attendance, a riot erupted just outside the stadium between protestors and police, injuring dozens and hundreds more arrested. This particular hockey riot is certainly indicative of Quebec's growing nationalism, as even our most sanctified sport is no longer immune to its ideas."

twrcanada.12.d:0 "Despite believing that the former party leader George A. Drew would lead the Tories to great successes within Federal elections, basing such off of his excellent showings in three successive provincial elections alongside Francophone ridings, hopes were dashed in the 1949 election - with the Progressive Conservatives losing well over 24 seats, leaving them at 41 members in the House of Commons. Eventually, an opportunity presented itself for the party: Drew's formal resignation as both Opposition Leader and head of the party, after a nearly fatal attack from meningitis.\n\nArranged for December, a leadership election has been called today, housed at the Ottawa Coliseum in Ontario. Many delegates within the party voiced their desire for change - to both coalesce into a formidable opposition to the Liberals, and to restore faith and popularity with conservative voters, who'd had animosity to George Drew's many fumbles. With few strong challengers, the winner was already seen far before the final tally. Receiving nominations from both the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Premiers, John Diefenbaker achieved victory within the first vote.\n\nHaving been frustrated by gerrymandering of traditionally Progressive Conservative ridings by the Liberals, and many attempts to unseat him, John Diefenbaker presents himself as a reformer - concentrating on changes to domestic policy, alongside working with the provinces to execute a reform of the Senate. Combined with extensive new agricultural policies, while reducing Canada's dependence on the United States for trade, and reaffirming her ties to the United Kingdom. Despite the Progressive Conservative platform being derided by Louis St. Laurent as being "a mere cream-puff of a thing—with more air than substance", Diefenbaker remained firm in his closing arguments:\n"We must remember where we came from - and what we are here for. The Progressive Conservatives stand for the people who the Liberals glass over with each election. Our farmers, woodworkers, and industrial workers. We are their voice - and we mustn't forget them.""
