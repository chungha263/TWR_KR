 twrArmenia.1.t:0 "The Death of Garegin"
 twrArmenia.1.d:0 "After years of leading our country, the great hero of Armenia, Garegin Nzhdeh, has died after suffering a stroke while giving a speech. While the sudden character of the stroke raised suspicions, it was discovered that his body had three rusting bullets, poisoning him slowly over the years. The sudden death of our great leader shook the whole nation. Thousands of loyalist citizens turned out to his funeral service to mourn him while in more rural areas of Armenia, many celebrated the death of the autocrat. \n\nAs his official successor, Simon Vratsiyan was placed in power. Known for his more right wing views and anti-Soviet ethos, Simon has already firmly grasped the reigns of power. His rule may not be stable, however, as many already begin to resent the rise of an autocrat."
 twrArmenia.1.a:0 "A national hero has passed away..."

 twrArmenia.2.t:0 "The Choice of the People"
 twrArmenia.2.d:0 "Since the death of Garegin and the rise of Simon, many citizens of Armenia have been protesting against the illegitimate heir state of Simon and its undemocratic nature. Demanding their own voice to be heard and represented, the people have taken to the streets with the red flags of Dashnak in their hands, demanding Simon be kicked out of power and replaced by the people's voice, Krikor Amirian. Its the choice of Simon whether to hear the voices of the people or continue his dictatorial rule."
 twrArmenia.2.a:0 "The people choose Dashnak!"
 twrArmenia.2.b:0 "Who cares what the people think?"

 twrArmenia.3.t:0 "A Plea for Protection"
 twrArmenia.3.d:0 "Now that we are a socialist republic, our sovereighnty is threatened by the constant fear of German invasion. We know one nation that can alleviate that fear though, the Americans. We will send them a proposal for a secret cooperative pact between our nations so in the case of attack by the Germans, we will have the protection of the stars and stripes!"
 twrArmenia.3.a:0 "Hopefully the West finally helps us."

 twrArmenia.4.t:0 "A Plea from Armenia"
 twrArmenia.4.d:0 "A letter arrived today at your office President from the new Socialist Republic of Armenia. According to them, they seek our protection as to protect their democracy from the claws of Nazism. The most hawkish among our leadership is calling for us to guarantee the independence of the new state to contain nazism wherever it may go, but many also suggest that committing to protect such a small country in a less strategically important location may be counterproductive."
 twrArmenia.4.a:0 "We must protect all against Nazism!"
 twrArmenia.4.b:0 "They are not even worth our time."

 twrArmenia.5.t:0 "The Americans Protect Us!"
 twrArmenia.5.d:0 "We received a letter this morning from the United States, recognising our new government and ensuring us that in any case of foreign invasion, they will protect our democracy! Another great day for Armenian democracy!"
 twrArmenia.5.a:0 "That will help our Republic stand!"

 twrArmenia.6.t:0 "The Americans Ignore Us!"
 twrArmenia.6.d:0 "Despite our please, the Americans have declined our plea for protection, leaving us once more to our own fate."
 twrArmenia.6.a:0 "Hopefully the mountains will protect our republic..."

 twrArmenia.7.t:0 "The United Armenia Question"
 twrArmenia.7.d:0 "It is said that a nation constitutes the same people living in the same place, and also in different places. This is the case of the Armenian nation, who in the past 1,600 years, have spread themselves or have been spread across south-eastern Europe and the Middle East. Now that we have a sovereign nation-state, the question of what to do about our diaspora, particularly the Armenian population in Turkey, has arisen within the halls of our government. Two main solutions have been put forward. \n\nThe first calls for us to physically recall the Armenian diaspora in Turkey back to the motherland. We will surely have to cooperate with the Turkish government in order to achieve this end, and they are likely to seek something else in return. This option is supported by most elements in our, though the exact details of how the repatriation will develop are still unclear. \n\nThe second calls for Armenian-Turkish condominiums to be established in the majority Armenian regions of Turkey. Armenians living in these areas would be entitled to dual citizenship, uninhibited transit between Armenia and Turkey, as well as other rights. While this option would maintain the ties that our countrymen have in Turkey, it is much more complicated than repatriation, and it isn't very likely that Turkey would agree to such a measure."
 twrArmenia.7.a:0 "Propose the return of all Armenians to our homeland."
 twrArmenia.7.b:0 "Propose the united governance of United Armenia."

 twrArmenia.8.t:0 "The United Population Proposal"
 twrArmenia.8.d:0 "The Armenian ambassador approached our legislator with a proposal from their government. Armenia seeks to unite all of its diaspora within its own borders, and they are asking us to transfer our Armenian population to them. What should be done about this?"
 twrArmenia.8.a:0 "At least we won't have to deal with rebels."
 twrArmenia.8.b:0 "We don't care about that worthless nation!"

 twrArmenia.10.t:0 "Turkey Agrees to Our Proposal!"
 twrArmenia.10.d:0 "The Turkish government has accepted our solution on the United Armenia question. All Armenians will now return to their homeland."
 twrArmenia.10.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers and sisters!"

 twrArmenia.11.t:0 "Turkey Denies our Proposal!"
 twrArmenia.11.d:0 "The Turkish government has rejected our solution on the United Armenia question. Armenians remain in diaspora for decades to come."
 twrArmenia.11.a:0 "First they slaughter us, now they prevent us from returning to our homeland?"

 twrArmenia.9.t:0 "The United Governance Proposal"
 twrArmenia.9.d:0 "The Armenian ambassador has approached us with a proposal from their government. Armenia seeks to establish a dual-government system in the regions of our country that have an Armenian majority or plurality. Our governments would both be responsible for the maintenance of the regions and the security of its citizens. What should we say in response?"
 twrArmenia.9.a:0 "We agree, establish the condominiums."
 twrArmenia.9.b:0 "We will not relinquish sovereignty over Turkish land."

 twrArmenia.12.t:0 "The United Governance of United Armenia!"
 twrArmenia.12.d:0 "The Turkish government has accepted our solution on the United Armenia question. All Armenians will have a connection to the motherland now."
 twrArmenia.12.a:0 "This is a historic moment for Armenia!"

 twrArmenia.13.t:0 "Our Proposal is Denied"
 twrArmenia.13.d:0 "The Turkish government has rejected our solution on the United Armenia question. Armenia remains a disparate nation."
 twrArmenia.13.a:0 "Cover up the plan and act like nothing happened."

 twrArmenia.14.t:0 "Protection from the Germans"
 twrArmenia.14.d:0 "As of right now, we lack any substantial allies, either within the Caucasus or beyond them. Our nation, however mighty it may be, is still small and vulnerable to foreign invasion. If we are to survive, finding protection from a stronger power will be key. \n\nSome members of our government have suggested building relations with the Reichskommissariat of Kaukasus, an appendage of the Third Reich that projects German power on the Caucasian region. There has undoubtedly been opposition to this proposal, as it is unsure where exactly our people fall on the German race hierarchy, and many have questioned exactly how much longer German hegemony will last. For now however, the government will pursue an alliance with the RK of Kaukasus."
 twrArmenia.14.a:0 "Ensuring our independence is mandatory by all means necessary!"

 twrArmenia.15.t:0 "A Request from Armenia"
 twrArmenia.15.d:0 "This morning, our office of state affairs received a telegram from the Armenian parliament. It contained a formal request from their government for a guarantee of their independence on our part. Accepting this would give us an opportunity to secure more power in the Caucasus, but it is uncertain whether or not this action would be approved by Berlin. How should we proceed?"
 twrArmenia.15.a:0 "Might as well have another puppet under our thumb."
 twrArmenia.15.b:0 "Deny the request, the Armenians are on their own."

 twrArmenia.16.t:0 "The Germans Protect Us!"
 twrArmenia.16.d:0 "The Reichskommissariat of Kaukasus has accepted our request for protection. Armenia no longer stands alone."
 twrArmenia.16.a:0 "Armenia will last against all!"

 twrArmenia.17.t:0 "No German Protection"
 twrArmenia.17.d:0 "The Reichskommissariat of Kaukasus has denied our request for protection. Armenia continues to stand alone."
 twrArmenia.17.a:0 "Damn those Nazi bastards!"

 twrArmenia.18.t:0 "The Transcaucasia Paper"
 twrArmenia.18.d:0 "With the ascendance of the Vratisyan government, the question of our place in the Caucasus has come up. It was not very long ago that we were united with the nations of Georgia and Azerbaijan, and though the old federation was a short lived experiment, the dream of a united Caucasian state still exists in the hearts of our people. Such a state would also surely secure our position in a region that is no stranger to the competition of greater powers. \n\nKeeping this reality in mind, the administration has put forward the so-called Transcaucasian Paper, which contains two distinct proposals for our regional relations. The first outlines a plan to recreate the former Transcaucasian federation by seeking out stronger relations with Georgia. This plan would ensure peace between us and Georgia, but the chances of the federation being reestablished do not seem to be in our favour. \n\nThe second suggests that we invade Georgia by force, securing our position militarily. While this may placate the nationalists and bring about prestige for our nation, we may very well lose in a war with Georgia. Even if we are to find victory, placing the Georgians under our boot will be another issue entirely. \n\nWill we seek to achieve the dormant idealism of Transcaucasia, or will we try to show the world that Armenia is not to be played with?"
 twrArmenia.18.a:0 "Request a diplomatic meeting with the Georgians."
 twrArmenia.18.b:0 "Begin preparations for the Greater Armenian summit."

 twrArmenia.19.t:0 "A Meeting of Old Memories"
 twrArmenia.19.d:0 "The Armenian Foreign Ministry has approached our government with a proposal not considered in decades. In the face of increasing tensions and uncertainty with neighbouring Turkey and the ever-unstable state of the Reich's Caucasian possessions, a political union between the States of Armenia and Georgia is imperative to ensure the freedom of all Caucasian peoples from foreign imperialists. This is not the first time that we've been in a Transcaucasian Federation however; It had been attempted in 1918 but met little success due to the invading Turks and the lack of support from the people at the time. But much has changed in the region since the end of the Great War, and the Armenian government has promised a new constitution guaranteeing unity and representation for the Georgian and Armenian peoples."
 twrArmenia.19.a:0 "We should give it another try!"
 twrArmenia.19.b:0 "It failed once, it will fail again!"

 twrArmenia.20.t:0 "Operation Mountain"
 twrArmenia.20.d:0 "Yergat slowly crouched through the dark forest, no sounds heard except the breaths of him and his comrades. Not even a week ago his battalion had been quickly roused from their comfy patrol job to deliver a crippling first strike against the cowardly Georgians with the element of surprise on their side. That of course meant that his bag was unusually light that day, their rations spread thin as the plan was assembled and executed quickly.In the distance the morning sun slowly revealed the army camp they'd been sneaking up on for the next couple hours.He readied his rifle, an alarm was sounded, screams that ordered him to charge the camp, a cheap shot at a half awake Georgian exciting his camp. He was inside the camp, hold his position, await the rest of his squad. A flash of metal in the corner of his eyes. Then he was drowning in his own blood. \n\nIn another time Agnuni was showing the first signs of nausea as his troops transport endlessly rattled across dirt roads. This time they had prepared, supplies aplenty and every maneuver repeated in training.The cost of course, the element of surprise. The Georgians awaited them.It was almost dawn, with the first rays of the morning sun he began to imagine the sound of battle, the thunder of artillery, however distant it was. He readied his rifle.The driver never saw the landmine. Which plan to choose and whom to die was with the army high command..."
 twrArmenia.20.a:0 "The element of surprise is ours!"
 twrArmenia.20.b:0 "Slow and steady wins the race!"
 twrArmenia.21.t:0 "The Transcaucasian Federation Reforms"
 twrArmenia.21.d:0 "It is not often that the piece of land squatted between two seas but news has reached that the countries of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia have reformed the brief Transcaucasian Federation.\n\nOriginally born out of compromise with the slaughting on Ottomans during the first great war and dissolved only one month later the Federations name rung ill in the countries people's ears for many years. \n\nOriginally born out of compromise with the slaughting on Ottomans during the first great war and dissolved only one month later the Federations name rung ill in the countries people's ears for many years. \n\nThis time is to be different has been declared, the federation born out its government - and by extension its citizens - collective to face this brave new world together, and not alone.With other countries in the region taking ill to the news already, even if hastily assembled declarations of gratulations have so far been sent, as well as the ever looming threat of the Union and the Reich - so far the vultures are only circling far enough."
 twrArmenia.21.a:0 "Lets see whether it'll last longer than the last time."
 twrArmenia.22.t:0 "Georgia Declines Talks"
 twrArmenia.22.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the Georgian government has declined our offer of talks for the possibility of a reformation of the Transcaucasian Federation. Why they would do such a thing is currently unclear as unification would be benefiting to both sides as a means of defense, this has led to the other factions of our government to call for a surprise strike on Georgia and the formation of a puppet government obedient to us. This has also hurt our government's reputation as the Transcaucasia Paper was generally expected to be successful."
 twrArmenia.22.a:0 "If they don't come peacefully, we will make them!"
 twrArmenia.23.t:0 "Victory over Georgia!"
 twrArmenia.23.d:0 "The Georgian government or what's left of it has capitulated to our forces,  with high-ranking generals of the Georgian army currently arranging terms of surrender. We have already drafted certain terms which include economic dependence, disarming the Georgian military, and a military alliance with our government. Using the remains of the Georgian military, we've established some order to the countryside; however, we still have some pockets of resistance in Tbilisi, but we should have no issues when we solidify our occupation. \n\nBecause most of the Georgian government fled by the time we reached Tbilisi, we have had to resort to a military occupation for now. Thankfully we have found some Georgian generals who are ambitious enough to lead a military junta loyal to our line. Although the exiled politicians will attempt to undermine this new government, ultimately the situation should stabilize, and the Georgian populace will accept this new order."
 twrArmenia.23.a:0 "Glory to Armenia!"
 twrArmenia.24.t:0 "Armenia is Lost!"
 twrArmenia.24.d:0 "The Georgian Royal Army has decisively routed our armies and has made it to the outskirts of Yerevan. After shelling the city repeatedly to force the capital garrison to surrender, the forces stormed the city to force the central government to surrender. Greeted with ruined roads, shelled buildings and small pockets of resistance, Georgian troops eventually secured Republic Square and forced our government to resign and put an end to the war. With little resistance from the shell-shocked politicians inside, parliament was subsequently dissolved. With a Georgian royalist junta taking charge and remaining resistance in the south being dealt with, there is no doubt now that the delicate balance of power in the Caucasus has not shifted in our favour."
 twrArmenia.24.a:0 "Ketstse Arkan..."
 twrArmenia.25.t:0 "The Transcaucasian Federation"
 twrArmenia.25.d:0 "Today a joint statement by the now-former governments of Armenia and Georgia has been released, detailing the formation of the Transcaucasian Federation. In the statement, a new government dominated by the current political parties of Armenia and Georgia has been announced along with a united army and federal legislation. Many political experts have noticed that the new country was formed for the sole purpose of defense. Already the federal government's authority has been challenged, raising doubts that the federation will be able to survive. Despite these challenges, the Armenian and Georgian parliaments are cooperating, and the first Transcaucasian government is slowly but surely forming."
 twrArmenia.25.a:0 "Governments like this rarely do."
