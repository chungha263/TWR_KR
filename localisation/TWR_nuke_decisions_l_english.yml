The middle-class suburbs of the city were swept by what witnesses describe as a \"wall of fire\", and among the hundreds of thousands of casualties are hundreds wounded by the storm of sharded glass in the business district.\n\nAltstadt itself, however, has not been so lucky. The city's historic core, and the network of rivers crisscrossing it, has been razed to the ground. Witnesses report only barren earth stretching for kilometers in every direction, and in its middle a barren cliff upon which the faintest imprints of rectangular rubble can still be seen. As Hamburg burns, Germany weeps with it."

The city’s financial and commercial centre, the Neustadt, has not fared much better: fires roar through the heart of Saxony, searing bankers and paupers alike.\n\nAccusations that the staunch stronghold of Nazi ideology was politically attacked have been met by silence, as have accusations of deliberate civilian targeting. The Haufkirche and Frauenkirche smoulder, and so too do the countless cultural treasures and human lives that made Dresden a vital heart of Europe burn, their ashes rising up to Heaven like unanswered prayers."

German authorities have been silent on the aftermath of the explosion, citing only Adolf Hitler’s famous maxim: \"Bomb shall be met by bomb.\""

Following reports of a billowing mushroom cloud above Munich's Königsplatz, electronic communications around the city have broken down and eyewitness accounts report intense firestorms characteristic of a nuclear attack.\n\nAs medical workers struggle to retrieve the remains of functionaries and schoolchildren visiting the Honor-Temples dedicated to Nazi war-heroes, Germany has already fielded accusations that the attack was made on primarily civilian targets and as an ideological statement. Perhaps the most trenchant commentary on the matter, however, is that of a doctor outside the city: \"What do the corpses care whether Hitler was right or wrong?\""

It is now none of those things; following a nuclear strike above the city centre, much of it has been reduced to angular scribble and shadows burnt into the pavement. The Cathedral has been nearly slagged into ruin, and nothing remains of the marketplace which once housed tens of thousands at Nöel.\n\nPictures from within the city centre have revealed indescribable horrors - people half-burnt to death, empty eye-sockets still dripping serum, on the ruined city streets. Medical authorities describe a scene of pure chaos as radiation poisoning and lack of supplies overwhelm them. The butchery, it appears, has only begun."

A detonation directly above the Palazzo della Farnesina has reportedly created a massive fireball rising above the old Seven Hills, destroying historical architecture millenia in the making. Eyewitness accounts also record the immediate collapse of civil authority in the city, as healthcare systems are overwhelmed.\n\nThe attack has already triggered international outcry for its provocation of the Vatican State; the Pope has reportedly been airlifted to a safe location, but St. Peter's Basilica has joined the burning, slagged ruins of the Colosseum and the crumbled obelisks in mutual devastation. The Papacy has itself been silent, save for a brief statement praying for forgiveness on the part of the attackers."

Eyewitness accounts tell of whole piazzas ripped apart from the ground up, fires rising up Vomero Hill and its mighty monastic gardens set ablaze.\n\nCastles have reportedly become refuges, as the Egg Castle swarms with people fleeing the incineration of their livelihoods and homes; local charitable organizations are struggling, in the chaos, to provide for a vastly expanded list of needy and homeless. Only time will tell if this beauty in the South will ever recover its former beauty, or if it will join so much of the ancient world in total collapse."

The famed Bank of St. George is no more, as are the shipyards that were once the pride of the maritime hub; now there is merely ruin from hill to coast, stretching in a broad arc encompassing the city centre.\n\nAs the city burns, so too do its people. Boats are reportedly capsizing off the Ligurian territories, overloaded with refugees and evacuees, and their swollen, burnt corpses tell a story deeper and more searing than mere words could ever manage."

The Palazzo Dei Normanni has survived, as have much of the historical castles that predominate this old city; alas, with the breakage of windows and the ravages of fire, their citizens have not.\n\nIn the city's many ancient cellars and tunnels, however, thousands have survived the fury, and reports suggest that charitable organizations are putting up a better fight against disease and radiation sickness than would otherwise have proven possible. Here, at least, the horror of nuclear war may yet be beaten back in time."

These images of horror are what is left of the burning wreck of Florence, as the heart of the Renaissance burns under a mushroom-cloud sky.\n\nThe incomparable horrors of the day leave little room for speculation: hundreds of thousands are dead, including several school delegations on a cultural tour of the city, and while the Fountain of Neptune yet stands, its half-melted visage looks upon a scene of pure devastation. Most of the city's suburbs are caught in an inferno of their own, one whose aftereffects will long outlast this day of misery."

Once a proud commercial and political centre, the City is now a place of nearly levelled buildings and broken bridges; the Italian government has decried the sheer destruction of the act as proof of utter barbarity.\n\nAs for witnesses, there are few indeed: the open nature of Venice spelled doom for its residents, and when the fire came there was no place to hide. Scattered, eyewitness accounts from immediately outside the city attest to watching citizens, half-aflame, collapse beside boiling rivers that offered no relief.

As medical services are overwhelmed by the dead and dying, refugees wait to die by their own illness.

As the American Government condemns the senseless violence of this attack, outrage sweeps the nation, and with it a sorrow that no rebuilding will ever heal."

Refugees report nightmarish scenes of boats in the harbor struggling to pick up half-burnt men before capsizing from the weight.\n\nThe city's great political dynasties have begun efforts to funnel in aid from the rest of America, and the Kennedys are reportedly leading the charge - but as the dust settles, it is clear to all that the city of Liberty has lost something immeasurable.

Even so, America weeps for its fallen, and for the city that shone too bright to last; Miami will rebuild, but its invulnerable spirit is forever lost."

twrnukes.26.d:0 "Beijing's sorrow is often that of China's itself - as a fireball sears through the districts of the Northern Capital, the screams of its death are echoed through the nation. Tiananmen Square and the Hall of the People, seared to ash by the storm - the siheyuans of the teeming suburbs, blown apart where they do not simply vanish off the face of the earth.\n\nAs the survivors - by some counts near a million - rise from the rubble, they are confronted with sights beyond human belief: one memorable photograph that has leaked to the international press has been that of a baby surrounded by rubble, sobbing against the angular shadow of a pillar and the shadow of what was once his mother - her arms still outstretched to clasp her child."

twrnukes.27.d:0 "Chongqing, the City of Rivers and Mountains, resounds: not with the sound of the monsoon or of thunder but of an unearthly horror, borne from the explosion far above its surface. The former Republican Capital burns uncontrollably, with the strength and force of the explosion rebounding onto the city after being bounced off the nearby mountains - although this dense geography has absorbed some of the traumatic force, it has not been nearly so successful in protecting its levelled buildings.\n\nAs survivors flee across the Ba mountains, they report scenes of surreal carnage: endless convoys of floating corpses heaped upon the Jialing River, floating across a cityscape virtually levelled by the blast. Witnesses to old carnage, and martyrs for a new one."

twrnukes.28.d:0 "An old heart of China crumbles before the inferno today: as witnesses report a fireball expanding above the city centre of Guizhou, a city that traces its roots back to the foundation of China itself is overcome with ruin. The hurricane-force inferno has spread to neighbouring districts, destroying newly built Republican commercial zones, and there is no hope that local authorities can contain the destruction.\n\nWith the burning of the old comes the death of the new: hundreds of thousands have taken refuge in Qingyan Town's half crumbled stone walls, and there they wait as disease and famine sweeps the broken city. As for the city centre itself, not much remains: the bustling heart of Jiaxiu Pavillion is ash and dust, taking the immortal poetry within it into history."

twrnukes.29.d:0 "The birthplace of the National Revolution has met with a brutal rebuke - as Wuchang, Hankou and Hanyang burn, set alight by the atomic candle burning overhead, millions in China's industrial heart burn with it. The sprawling industrial estates of China's companies are choked with smoke, bodies and disease as toxic as the infernos outside.\n\nAs with industry, so with people. Zhongshan Avenue and a hundred others burn with nightmare-fires, the Bund and Armory are crumbled to dust and the Golden Waterway is itself a boiling soup of dead bodies and rubble: there is nowhere for the survivors to hide, and for those that cannot flee on the packed roads into the Central Plain only a slow, lingering death awaits."

twrnukes.30.d:0 "London burns, again. Death follows the fire, first in the shockwave that sweeps Central London, then in the chaos as everything, everywhere, explodes into flame. Fire-wreathed spectres stumble out of smouldering metal pyres melting into the seared tar of what used to be highways in Westminster. Behind them the arteries and the vitals of a nation that thought itself Imperial melt apart like playthings in the sun.\n\nAs they gaze across the melted steeples of Parliament, the horizon glowing from end to end in the direction of what used to be Aldersgate, the suddenly-boiling Thames choked with the debris of broken boats - the screams begin, and they go on and on and on in a nightmare liturgy. They do not, however, stop. They will not stop for quite awhile."

It was proven wrong today: the Bull Ring of Birmingham, Colmore Row and Jewelry Quarter have been razed to the ground by a single warhead far more powerful than any mere incendiary bomb. Fires rage across the wider Birmingham area, unchecked and uncontainable, and leave suburbs ravaged shells in their wake.\n\nThis is only the beginning, however, of Birmingham's sorrow. As the population clusters in surviving shelters in the south and east, refugees speak of new horrors of illness and famine spreading - and of elderly dazed by shock wandering into the fires, never to return."

Liverpool's famed cultural and musical beats, stemming from its diverse West Indian and Commonwealth-wide expatriates, have been burned to the ground as well: the pubs of Islington and Mathews Street are one with Nineveh and Tyre, and their musicians have melted into the crowds streaming away in every direction.\n\nFor the survivors there is no help coming from the Government: medical and civil authorities have barely responded to rising panic, famine and death counts, and incidents of officials attempting to flee the blazing harborfront have become fuel for division in an already suffering Britain."

The Channel has caught most of the radioactive fallout, according to civil correspondents, but this has only brought a horror-tide of dying boat-crews and sea vessels into a town crippled by its own burning.\n\nAs refugees struggle with the dying and dead to claw their way to the safety of the Channel, medical authorities have reportedly resorted to dumping bodies off the coast - vast, unmarked floating patches of corpses now litter the Channel, nauseating reminders of an atrocity perpetrated on an innocent port town."

twrnukes.34.d:0 "When the end comes for Sheffield, it comes in a quick, sharp burst. A mushroom cloud detonates in the middle of South Sheffield, along the Canal, in a suburb called Tinsley: this district is vaporized, as is much of South Yorkshire proper, the industrial core of Sheffield, and the city centre. There are violent firestorms and earthquakes - mothers lose sons in the inferno, lovers torn apart figuratively and literally by the winds of Hades.\n\nSurvivors encounter scenes for which Bosch would have struggled to find the words. A police officer, swaddled in bloody bandages around the face, yells at a weeping woman clutching a wizened corpse. Around them lie the bodies, bloated and half-burnt, of thousands upon thousands, unburied and rotting - the lucky ones."

Glasgow's famed modern streets are torn to barbarity as well, smoking shells of their former selves upon which the survivors stagger to find help that will never arrive.\n\nThe rubble of the City Chambers will prove no help to the milling crowds, as will the chaos unfolding upon George Square: amidst the desperate calls for help and the cries of the dying and heavily wounded come a call for justice from a distant London. There is talk of betrayal in the city's refugee centers, betrayal that becomes ever sharper with each missed food ration - even, it is whispered, of separatism."
