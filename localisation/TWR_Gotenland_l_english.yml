RGO_commercial_use_of_helicopters:0 "Commercial Use Of Helicopters"
RGO_commercial_use_of_helicopters_desc:0 "Perhaps we can actually make money out of our new helicopters, as our tourism board suggests. Many would-be tourists would be willing to pay a lot of Reichsmarks to fly over our gorgeous skies and beaches. We should take advantage of this!"

RGO_gotenland_international_airport_desc:0 "With our air infrastructure now in place throughout Gotenland, perhaps it is time we begin construction of our largest project yet; a large international airport capable of processing hundreds of the Reich's citizens as well as those of the Fatherland's allies."

RGO_national_bunker_system_desc:0 "It is not unlikely that Gotenland is stricken by the detonation of one or more enemy nuclear weapons, and as such our people must be prepared to shelter from atomic hellscape.

RGO_gotische_heer:0 "Gotische Heer"
RGO_gotische_heer_desc:0 "Gotenland is no doubt the jewel of the SS. In order to keep it that way, we will need to re-examine our policy with the military. On the one hand, we could expand our purview and recruit a less "elite" army, but allow us to expand our numbers.

RGO_the_bastion_of_national_socialism_desc:0 "Our "brothers" across the Reich have fallen far from grace. Gotenland, however, remains pure. It is imperative to the survival of National Socialism we project this in everyday life. We must take measures to improve Aryan military measures here."

RGO_civic_defense_program:0 "Civic Defense Program"
RGO_civic_defense_program_desc:0 "We sadly cannot expect everyone to, at all times, be conscripted into our ranks. We can, however, require a less formal, more civilian "defense program". This would not only bolster our military numerically, but also train for urban resistance in case of invasion."
RGO_unshakable_will:0 "Unshakable Will"
RGO_unshakable_will_desc:0 "Remember the basics. We are Germans. The decadence and docile lifestyle of outsiders may serve their hedonistic will, however Gotenland will stand apart. We must never forget who we are. Should war befall our little project, we must be ready to win by any means necessary. Perhaps propaganda will encourage our citizens."
RGO_totaler_krieg:0 "Totaler Krieg"
RGO_totaler_krieg_desc:0 "The sword is, in fact, mightier than the pen. In case of war, we cannot forsake this. Rally our citizens, stir their hearts, and prepare them for nothing short of total war. We will defend every inch of Gotenland with our lives."
RGO_auxiliary_integration:0 "Auxiliary Integration"
RGO_auxiliary_integration_desc:0 "Though our standing army is strong, it is lacking in numbers. Perhaps to nullify this issue, we should consider merging citizen-formed military units into the army.

RGO_formalize_the_volkssturm:0 "Formalize The Volkssturm"
RGO_formalize_the_volkssturm_desc:0 "The Volkssturm was a good idea, and certainly helped keep our citizens in line. However, our lacking military makes it necessary to take this rag-tag team of average Germans and equip them with top grade gear and armor."
RGO_unbreakable_lines:0 "Unbreakable Lines"
RGO_unbreakable_lines_desc:0 "Our borders are small and will not require much to fortify. Economically, it should not be an issue. They are lacking in the defense department, and in order to sustain Gotenland from outside degeneracy, we must wall off our border with bunkers and trenches."
RGO_fortress_mentality:0 "Fortress Mentality"
RGO_fortress_mentality_desc:0 "Though we have fortified Gotenland literally, we also need to do so figuratively. We have, generally, inspired the people. We could always use more, though, and it's time to instill a "do or die" attitude into our population. We fight to the last man!"
RGO_an_elite_force:0 "An Elite Force"
RGO_an_elite_force_desc:0 "Perhaps that instead of making a large, conscripted army, we focus on having a smaller manpower pool that is more selective. That way, we can have more elite strikeforces defending our interests."
RGO_panzergrenadiers:0 "Panzergrenadiers"
RGO_panzergrenadiers_desc:0 "They were used during the War, and they proved successful then. In order to protect our small amount of troops, we should equip them with armored vehicles. This way, they can not only be protected when transporting but also move quicker."
RGO_infantry_supports_armor:0 "Infantry Supports Armor"
RGO_infantry_supports_armor_desc:0 "To make up for our smaller army size, we should put an emphasis on vehicles such as tanks to make up for it. That way, we can send more protected units into battle, with the army following them as opposed to vice versa. This will, theoretically, save us much needed troops."
RGO_modern_mechanized_designs:0 "Modern Mechanized Designs"
RGO_modern_mechanized_designs_desc:0 "Though we may have highly trained troops and armor, it is nothing if it is comprised of the dated armor of the past. To rectify this, we need to develop cutting edge technology to effectively enforce our new doctrine."
RGO_clear_land_for_industrial_use:0 "Clear Land For Industrial Use"
RGO_clear_land_for_industrial_use_desc:0 "In order to implement them, we need to produce the necessary equipment. while Gotenland is geographically small, there is still land that we can clear for industrial use. We may have to convert some factories, but they will understand it is to advance the SS cause."
RGO_military_industry:0 "Military Industry"
RGO_military_industry_desc:0 "Other nations may feed their indulgences by using their workforce to produce materiel goods, but we reject such debauchery. We should be putting industry to use for the military, not for frivolous commodities. It's time to show the world the power of our war machine."
RGO_truck_factories:0 "Truck Factories"
RGO_truck_factories_desc:0 "Tanks and armored cars are great for our military industry, but we will need some civilian use after all. So, why not the best of both world and begin pumping out trucks? These can be sold both as a civilian vehicle and a military transport. The most bang for your buck."
RGO_heavy_vehicle_factories:0 "Heavy Vehicle Factories"
RGO_heavy_vehicle_factories_desc:0 "We have our industry spread to cater to a wide variety of military demands. We should dedicate a portion of that to heavy vehicles in order to keep with the times."
RGO_zukunftspanzer:0 "Zukunftspanzer"
RGO_zukunftspanzer_desc:0 "Everything has been leading up to this, the next step in military design. The brightest minds of the SS and the German race as a whole have dedicated months to this. Finally, we can roll out the next generation in vehicle design. Cutting edge, futuristic tanks that operate as killing machines will change warfare forever."

RGO_Gotisch_Politics:0 "Gotische Politics"
RGO_Gotisch_Politics_desc:0 "Gotic politics have long been dominated by slightly tweaked version of the \"Führerprinzip\" like the one that reigns so long in Berlin, now Germania, here with Reinhard Heydrich the Reichsführer SS most trusted being at the helm of the nation in every sense of the word. Nigh every decision going through Heydrich's circle of advisors and favored. \n\nNow the fair beast hungers for more...and we shall provide."
RGO_Fall_Of_Third_Reich:0 "Fall of the Reich"
RGO_Fall_Of_Third_Reich_desc:0 "For years we have laid low, for years we have endured. Now the time to strike has come. With Germania in flames it is now time to begin our true work. Unshackled from the degeneracy of the Reichs labyrinthine bureaucracy and excesses of Göring and Speer we shall create a true Aryan state here in Gotenland. May it reign untarnished for a thousand years to come!"
RGO_Independent_Gotenland:0 "Independent Gotenland"
RGO_Independent_Gotenland_desc:0 "For Gotenland to be strong it must be free of degeneracy that has once more befallen the Reich. We shall make sure that no official that holds any degree of loyalty to Germania remains in the halls of power and no worker that does the same remains on the streets."
RGO_Expand_Gotische_Claims:0 "Expand Gotische Claims"
RGO_Expand_Gotische_Claims_desc:0 "With Gotenland now free we are free to act in any way we wish. It is time to grow Gotenland to the true glory it deserves. Not one dictated by an aging man on an alabaster throne far away but the will of the leader of a horde of perfect Aryan specimen."
RGO_True_Aryan_State:0 "True Aryan State"
RGO_True_Aryan_State_desc:0 "Thanks to Hitler's folly the Reich has once more been plagued by foreign degeneracy, twisted beyond recognition from its glorious beginnings. But not all is lost.

RGO_Loyalist_Exiles_desc:0 "With the civil war raging a few loyal sons of the Reichsführer SS became prodigal, cast out against their will and more importantly unable to complete their sacred duty to the twin lightning.

RGO_Attract_German_Refugees:0 "Attract German Refugees"
RGO_Attract_German_Refugees_desc:0 "Thousands flee the Reich weekly from the raging civil war. While most are either feeble civilians or traitorous degenerates a few are those still holding the true Aryan spirit within them. We shall offer them refuge and reward so they may strengthen the future stronghold of true national socialism."
RGO_Urbanize_Gotenland:0 "Urbanize Gotenland"
RGO_Urbanize_Gotenland_desc:0 "With the tide of flesh flooding Gotenland we need brick and cement to house them all.

RGO_Proclaim_The_Gotsiche_Reich_desc:0 "With the true Aryan once more being free to shape the world in his image it is time to repeat history.

RGO_Ukraine_Raids:0 "Ukrainian Raids"
RGO_Ukraine_Raids_desc:0 "The Untermensch is especially despicable in the territory that once was called Ukraine. With the current Reichskommissar being unable to properly show the subhuman their place it is time once more to assert our supremacy of Europe now...and one day the world."
RGO_Gotische_Oil_Raids:0 "Oil Theft"
RGO_Gotische_Oil_Raids_desc:0 "The christians god in his magnanimity said that the meek shall one day inherit the earth. Yet the false god never accounted for the mighty.

twrgotenland.1.t:0 "The Dark Pearl"
twrgotenland.1.d:0 "Gotenland - the model Schutzstaffel colony of German Eastern Europe. With the land formerly known as Crimea assigned to Reinhard Heydrich, he was given the task to turn Gotenland into an Aryan paradise. Heydrich was able to accomplish this task will full efficiency, including the 'removal' of the old population and its resettlement by eager German settlers, within 3 years, Crimea turned into nothing but a distant memory. Gotenland is close to being fully Germanised, and nowadays it's a fanatical dictatorship that acts highly autonomously from Germania, under a cult of personality around Reinhard Heyrdich, while also serving as a key tourism and propaganda region of the Reich under the Strength through Joy program."
twrgotenland.1.a:0 "For Heydrich and Gotenland!"

twrgermangotenland.1.t:0 "Reinforcing Gotenland"

twrgotenland.53.d:0 "With modified German rockets, Gotenland has announced the start of the Gotische Space Program, aiming to reach space, seemingly matching Germany in terms of technology.

twrgotenland.52.t:0 "Rocket Testing"
twrgotenland.52.d:0 "To test our arsenal, we are now launching rockets straight into the Black Sea. While Turkish authorities seemed to be reporting these to the international community, nobody can stop the Gotishe progression into Aryanhood."

twrgotenland.51.t:0 "Black Sea Helicopter Tour"
twrgotenland.51.d:0 "With the latest experimental helicopters imported directly from the black market, Gotenland will organise Black Sea Helicopter Tours, for our tourists to enjoy.

twrgotenland.32.t:0 "Unsatisfied Tourist"
twrgotenland.32.d:0 "After the flashy shows of force and grand tours, Helmut Goebbels was unimpressed due to the his luxurious lifestyle in Germania. Helmut was heard saying his experience in Gotenland was 'God awful' and left Gotenland in a rush. This is a massive blow to Gotenland's prestige as a model colony, and Gotenland's image among the high circles of Germania might be ruined."
twrgotenland.32.a:0 "Scheisse!"

twrgotenland.33.t:0 "Helmut Impressed"
twrgotenland.33.d:0 "Helmut Goebbels was fascinatedwith all the marching and grand tours within Gotenland. Before leaving, Helmut Goebbels remarked on the beauty of Gotenland, and suggested telling his father about the wonderful achievements of the SS colony. This will surely be an amazing public relations stunt for Gotenland's tourism industry."
twrgotenland.33.a:0 "That's good."
