 ##Focus
 RMO_Moskowien_in_Chaos:0 "혼란에 빠진 모스코비엔"
 RMO_Moskowien_in_Chaos_desc:0 "단지 시간 문제였습니다. 더 많은 준비를 했어야 했지만, 이제 혁명의 불길이 맹렬히 타오르고 있습니다. 본국을 휩쓸고 있는 혼란이 우리를 이 국경 지대로 보냈습니다. 우리는 독일에서 멀리 떨어져 있고, 또 우리끼리만 있습니다."
 RMO_Relocate_the_Work_Camps:0 "노동수용소 이전"
 RMO_Relocate_the_Work_Camps_desc:0 "We need to relocate our work camps to settler-controlled territory as soon as possible. With the rapid advance of the enemy lines, there's a non-negligible possibility that any prisoners they free will join their ranks. We cannot afford to lose the labor our vast prison population provides."
 RMO_The_Last_Fight:0 "최후의 전투"
 RMO_The_Last_Fight_desc:0 "우리의 힘겨운 투쟁은 순식간에 희망이 없어졌습니다. 대열은 무너지고, 원주민들이 떼를 지어 반란군에 가담하고 있습니다. 이대로만 있을 수는 없습니다. 우리의 입장을 확고히 할 때가 왔습니다. 우리는 자유인으로 살거나, 자유인으로 죽을 것입니다."
 RMO_Terror_Tactics:0 "테러 전술"
 RMO_Terror_Tactics_desc:0 "The rebels are ruthless. We will have to be worse. Our SA security forces can't be beholden to restraint in times such as these. We must harden our hearts and dig in our heels. If the Slavs want their freedom so bad we'll make them earn it."
 RMO_Establish_the_Reichsautonomie:0 "국가자치구 수립"
 RMO_Establish_the_Reichsautonomie_desc:0 "A radical reform has been proposed: delegate more power to local governments and autonomous settler communities. Unfortunately, this will give the natives more representation and agency to manage their affairs, but we have to bring them to the negotiating table somehow."
 RMO_The_Slavic_Solution:0 "슬라브인 충원"
 RMO_The_Slavic_Solution_desc:0 "원주민들을 SA에 받아들여야 합니다. 우리 정부가 이 폭풍을 견뎌낸다면, 그들은 군인의 임금과 특정한 정치적 권리를 보장받을 것입니다. 비록 인기 있는 제안은 아니지만, 우리는 무엇보다도 인력이 필요합니다. 지금 같은 상황에서는 마다할 여유가 없습니다."
 RMO_Abandon_the_Kommissariat:0 "판무관부 포기"
 RMO_Abandon_the_Kommissariat_desc:0 "신에게서 버림받은 이 식민지를 탈출해 결코 뒤돌아보지 말아야 합니다. 우리는 항공기에 연료를 공급했으며, 카셰와 그의 최측근들은 돈과 중요한 서류들로 가득 찬 여행가방을 싸들고 독일 본국으로 돌아갈 준비를 마쳤습니다. 이제 손을 뗍시다."
 RMO_Evacuate_the_Germans:0 "독일인 대피"
 RMO_Evacuate_the_Germans_desc:0 "반란군들은 우리를 마지막 한 사람까지 살해할 것입니다. 걱정스러울 정도로 많은 수의 정착민들이 여전히 판무관부에 남아있습니다. 그들 모두를 구해낼 수는 없겠지만, 더 부유한 사람들을 우선 대피시키는 것은 가능합니다. 우리 루프트바페는 그들을 독일 본국으로 대피시킬 것입니다."
 RMO_Our_Final_Hours:0 "우리의 마지막 시간"
 RMO_Our_Final_Hours_desc:0 "시계가 12시를 알렸습니다. 후퇴도 없고 항복도 없을 것입니다. 남은 병력들이 아직 우리가 통제중인 지역을 요새화했습니다. 지금 우리가 할 수 있는 일은, 최대한 버티면서 가능한 많은 적들을 함께 데려가는 것입니다."
 
 RMO_Return_of_Stability:0 "안정성 재확보"
 RMO_Return_of_Stability_desc:0 "모든 역경에도 굴하지 않고, 정부는 원주민들의 반란을 이겨냈습니다. 이제 폭풍우가 지나갔으니, 우리의 자랑스러운 식민지를 재건할 시간입니다. 우리는 그동안 원주민들에게 너무 관대했습니다. 이제는 철권이 필요합니다."
 RMO_Oust_the_Former_Government:0 "전임 정권 축출"
 RMO_Oust_the_Former_Government_desc:0 "지크프리트 카셰는 그의 직책을 더럽혔습니다. 애초에 SA 출신을 믿은 게 잘못이었습니다. 그는 벌새 작전 당시 살아남도록 허락받아서는 안 되었습니다. 그가 이 이상 망쳐놓지 못하도록 예방조치를 취하지 않으면, 더 많은 문제를 일으킬 것이 뻔합니다."
 RMO_Relocate_the_Capital:0 "수도 이전"
 RMO_Relocate_the_Capital_desc:0 "정치적으로 심하게 불안정한 모스크바는 우리 정부의 소재지로 부적합합니다. 따라서 발트해를 경유해 독일 본국과 직접 닿을 수 있고, 독일인 비율도 높은 편인 아르한겔스크에서 직무를 수행할 것입니다. 인근의 크릭스마리네 함대가 제공하는 약간의 보안 향상은 덤입니다."
 RMO_Restore_the_Kommissariat:0 "판무관부 재수립"
 RMO_Restore_the_Kommissariat_desc:0 "지크프리트 카셰는 내전에서 훌륭하게 활약했습니다. 아리아 민족에 대해 근면하고 변함없는 헌신을 바친 그의 직책은 즉시 복권될 것입니다. 비록 실수는 있었지만, 다 우리의 식민지 개척에 있어 귀중한 경험 아니겠습니까."
 RMO_Sturmabteilung_Policing:0 "돌격대 치안활동"
 RMO_Sturmabteilung_Policing_desc:0 "SA는 카셰가 치안 유지를 맡기기 위해 조직을 부활시킨 이후로 줄곧 식민지를 잘 섬기고 있습니다. 내전 중 SS의 배신 행위에도 불구하고, SA는 충성스럽고 믿음직스러운 모습으로 남았습니다. 그들은 인정받을 자격이 있습니다. 치안 활동과 반파르티잔 임무 수행은 수요가 많으니까요."
 RMO_Decentralize_the_Government:0 "Decentralize the Government"
 RMO_Decentralize_the_Government_desc:0 "Further decentralization will be required to restore Moskowien's functionality. Greater authority will be vested in local and regional officials to manage their own affairs. This will hopefully ease tensions with settler leaders. It will also give native collaborator officials more of a say in the RK's governance."
 RMO_The_Autonomous_German_Communities:0 "The Autonomous German Communities"
 RMO_The_Autonomous_German_Communities_desc:0 "From now on, the RK's settler communities will operate with greater autonomy than they have previously. They'll still answer to us but they'll be permitted to pass their own legislation and handle local affairs at their own discretion."
 RMO_Arisches_Schicksai:0 "Arisches Schicksai"
 RMO_Arisches_Schicksai_desc:0 "We Aryan men are destined to tame this land for our families, our volk, and our nation. We won't live in peace until the Slavs are vanquished. We need to expand the settlements and bring in more good German families from back home. The population shall increase tenfold!"
 RMO_Minimalistic_Administration:0 "Minimalistic Administration"
 RMO_Minimalistic_Administration_desc:0 "Less government is the best government. We'll allow local administrators to do as they please without interfering in their collections. Moskowien will be all the better for it. The Slavic collaborators will have the petty power they so desire. Hopefully they'll keep the rest of their kind in line."
 RMO_Resume_Basic_Operations:0 "Resume Basic Operations"
 RMO_Resume_Basic_Operations_desc:0 "Now that some measure of stability has returned, agricultural and industrial productions are to resume immediately. The natives will have to get back to work if they want to hold on to what few privileges they have left. Things should be smoother from here on out."

 RSB_Tachanka:0 "현대식 타찬카"
 RSB_Tachanka_desc:0 "Inspired by Nestor Makhno and limited by local resources, the anarchists have managed to scramble a dozen of Tachanka Brigades with stolen equipment. These open wagons are equipped with Soviet and German machine guns, designed to be the best alternative to conventional motorize equipment, creating the strange phenomenon which modern equipment such as MG-42 strapped onto a wagon pulled by horses."
 WRM_White_Army:0 "신백군"
 WRM_White_Army_desc:0 "Due to the amount of ex-White military staff working for the army, this created the appearance of a new White Army within Moskowien. With similar tactics, and a number of former White Army officers being part of the force."
 RMO_unloyal_servants:0 "불충한 협력자들"
 RMO_unloyal_servants_desc:0 "While the Moskowien's stance on native slavs have been a harsh one, the Reichskommissariat had no choice but to collaborate with certain groups of natives. These Slavic collaborators are used as factory inspectors, auxiliary law enforcers, and even a form of political entity. However, these groups' loyalty are questionable, and it's possible that most of them are plotting Moskowien's demise."
 RMO_uncontrolled_corruption:0 "통제되지 않는 부패"
 RMO_uncontrolled_corruption_desc:0 "While corruption is a problem for all of the Reichskommissariats, it is especially worse within Moskowien. The government is virtually non-functional with the insane amount of delays and corruption involved."
 RMO_slave_factories:0 "노예국가"
 RMO_slave_factories_desc:0 "While Reichskommissariat Moskowien isn't a specialist colony with specific resources to serve Germany, Moskowien functions as the Eastern European Factory of the Reich, having hundreds of slave workshops operating around the clock throughout the region. These workshops are often producing different types of products under Nazi conglomerates and certain state apparatus, such as the Schutzstaffel."
 TMS_Torch_of_Hope:0 "희망의 봉화"
 TMS_Torch_of_Hope_desc:0 "With a more attractive slogan and beliefs, the people under the Soviet Democrats found themselves living in a more fair, and refined system than other factions. While certain rights are still limited, citizens of the Soviet Democrats enjoy greater rights and have more power on minor state affairs."

#LEADER DESC
Paustovsky_DESC:0 "Served as a war correspondent on the Southern Front, Paustovsky was captured by the Wehrmacht when he was attempting to cross the Volga. Paustovsky was sent to a labour camp in Poland, later being relocated to work as a slave labour in Moskowien. Paustovsky was assigned to metalworking factory located in Tver, where he developed anarchist beliefs. He viewed the Soviet's collapse as the failure of the Statist Soviets, where millions of citizens were abandoned by the statists. He also treated the Germans' brutality as the fault of the concept of 'nation', seeing both the Soviets and Nazis as the cause of suppression in Russia.\n\nRadicalized and educated, Paustovsky used his knowledge to convert fellow labourers to the anarchist ideal. With the Death of Hitler, his status in the now crypto-anarchist stronghold was elevated, which he used to launch a righteous revolution in order to pave a new way for the anarchist utopia."
Korzh_DESC:0 "Commander of the Soviet Partisans in Moscow, Korzh has managed to evade numerous attempts on his life done by the Sturmabteilung. His zone of operation remained in the area of Northern Moskowien, where he managed to gain a large amount of followers and equipment with the help of the Soviet Union. Korzh's hit-and-run tactics were proven to be hugely effective, managing to raise an underground army of liberated slave labourers.\n\nKorzh's only aim is to reunify Moscow with the Soviets, no matter the cost of human lives and resources."
POLITICS_SIEGFRIED_KASCHE_DESC:0 "A General Officer of the Sturmabteilung, Siegfried Kasche avoided most SA Officers' fate, barely dodging death by pleaing to Hermann Göring. Later on, Kasche secured the position of Moskowien Reichskommissar with his pandering and politicking towards the German High Command.\n\nKasche has been using the Sturmabteilung as his means of oppression within Moskowien, favouring them over the typical security departments.\n\nKasche is ruthless in reaching production quotas, having zero sympathy towards any non-German living in his 'fiefdom' known as Reichskommissariat Moskowien."
Skorodumov_DESC:0 "Mikhail Skorodumov, a former member of the White Movement during the Russian Civil War, after the defeat of the Soviet Union he became one of the top ranking Nazi collaborator. After the relationship soured between the collaborators and the Reichskommissariat Government, Skorodumov established a hidden circle of resistance, and remained in contact with the Russian Republic in the East. Skorodumov managed to form a government after the slave rebllion sparked in Moskowien, with the goal of reuniting Moscow with the Republic."
Grigorenko_DESC:0 "Petro Grigorenko stayed within the Moskowien Region after the Soviet retreat. In the first years of his resistance career, he and his group of partisans fought under the NKVD's command. However, after the rumours of gross misconducts performed by Lavrentiy Beria surfaced, Grigorenko's group of partisans silently renounced their ties and defied NKVD orders. Grigorenko converted to an ideology of Soviet Democracy, and actively denounced the dictatorial Soviet Union."
Diky_DESC:0 "Andrey Dikiy emigrated to Yugoslavia after the Russian Civil War. Dikiy joined the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, which he became a leading figure within the organisation. After the rule of Nazi Europe consolidated, Dikiy cooperated and praised the Nazis administration. However, the incompetence of Reichskommissariat Moskowien drove his organisation into a more nationalistic stance. While Dikiy retained most of his national socialistic views, his attitude on the Germans changed from cooperation to Russian Nationalism."

 twrmoskowien.1.d:0 "Moskowien is a Slavic state.  And we are pure Germans.  To avoid en masse revolts and the regime being toppled, things must change.  After several meetings, with communist partisans, and underground slave unions, a compromise has been reached.  We will completely restructure our state, and it's governing ideology.  No more shall slavs be slaves, they shall be workers, with basic socialist rights.  No longer shall the military control all walks of life, the proletarian Germans and Slavs shall form a civilian branch of government.  No longer shall German corporations exploit our resources without paying, we shall institute common land reform.  A new day is rising, and with it, the bright light of National Bolshevism.  The Kommissariat has ended.  The Union Of National Bolshevik Republics has risen.  Long live the UNBR!"

 twrmoskowien.3.d:0 "Heart-wrenching news is coming out of Moskow.  The city has fallen to the rebellious slavs and their \"Blue Army\".  After months of fighting that made the battles for the Reich look like a tea-party, the last bastion of our troops has fallen.  They held out in the Kommissariat building for over a week after the rest of the city has fallen.  Only four men have returned, using a helicopter to escape, after collecting as many identification tags as they could from the soldiers who stayed behind.  They tell us a truly Hallowed tale.  On the evening the battles was to be fought, the blue army proceeded to blast the old Soviet anthem throughout city speakers, in an attempt to demoralize our forces before attacking.  This did not have the response they desired.  Our troops, lead by their commanding officer began to sing Deutschland Über Alles at the top of their lungs, and played it in their one remaining speaker.  Four almost an hour these men kept singing, while inflicting astronomical casualties on the Blues.  The survivors claim to have heard it literally until the last sound of gunshots, as they flew away.  Even now, many of us can almost hear their voices from the next world, as if their Spirit guides us onward.  All of these men were perhaps the greatest men to ever live and die for the Reich.  We have no current honor fitting for this occasion.  Thus we shall create a new one.  The Order of Eternal Unwavering Loyalty, which shall never again be awarded.  All the men present shall receive this, the Iron Cross First and Second Class, and posthumous promotions to the rank of Colonel, or Field Marshall for their commanding officer."

These rumours sparked a sense of hope amongst the slaves, reports are flooding into our headquarters regarding slaves defying German owners.\n\nThe local SA Branch has decided to take matters into their own hands, refusing to contact Germany for aid while sending their own regiments of paramilitary cells to handle the rowdy slaves."
