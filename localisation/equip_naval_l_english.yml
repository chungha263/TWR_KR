 ship_hull_submarine_1_desc:0 "Submarines are stealthy vessels designed to take out undefended convoys. The early models from the Great War pave the way for new methods of naval warfare."
 ship_hull_submarine_2_desc:0 "Better armed and more stable, new submarine designs are made to take advantage of advancements in naval tactics and have longer range, being able to attack distant convoy routes."
 ship_hull_submarine_3_desc:0 "The role of the submarine in the fleet outside of convoy attacks is still under debate. Achieving a balance between combination of speed, range and weaponry will be key to the necessary model."
 ship_hull_submarine_4_desc:0 "Increased test depth and efficient layouts will be features of the modern submarines, taking advantage of field experience to select appropriate armaments and engines."
 ship_hull_light_1_desc:0 "To ensure the safety of convoys, the destroyers of the Great War must be repurposed and developed. Arming vessels with more torpedoes will allow more opportunities to engage."
 ship_hull_light_2_desc:0 "Longer torpedo range and faster reload speeds, along with new types of armaments such as anti-air turrets, will allow our destroyers to remain efficient and versatile."
 ship_hull_light_3_desc:0 "To better face threats from above and below, new destroyers must be outfitted with radar and modern anti-air and anti-submarine weaponry."
 ship_hull_light_4_desc:0 "The modern destroyer must be fitted with a variety of different detection technologies, new depth charge deployment systems and be built at a larger scale than their predecessors."
 ship_hull_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Although bound by the stipulations of the Washington Naval Treaty, the cruiser is still the most flexible warship. This hull allows construction of a light cruiser for screening and scouting, or a heavy cruiser to support the battleline."
 ship_hull_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The next generation of cruisers features new engine arrangements that improve survivability, as well as space for dedicated aircraft facilities."
 ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As cruisers around the world get more powerful and capable, new and larger hulls are needed to hold all the extra equipment needed."
 ship_hull_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Influenced by wartime experiences, the latest generation of cruisers have a rearranged superstructure to allow wider fields of fire for anti-air armaments and new internal layouts to support the use of radar."
 ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armored vessels ever built."
 ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "With improved stability and range, a new generation of battleships improve upon previous designs while remaining within limits stipulated by naval treaties."
 ship_hull_heavy_3_desc:0 "Thicker armor, stronger engines, a battery of high-caliber guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
 ship_hull_heavy_4_desc:0 "As the world sees what may be the last major battleship confrontations, the importance of heavy armaments and anti-air turrets is greater than ever."
 ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc:0 "The current state of the world no longer has any room for abiding by naval treaties. Without these limitations, we can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 ship_hull_carrier_1_desc:0 "Many military theorists believe that naval aviation is the future. Converting old capital ships and ocean liners to carry aircraft will be the first step towards utilizing these new doctrines."
 ship_hull_carrier_2_desc:0 "As work begins on the first keel-up carrier designs, we must ensure that these ships have the range and speed to keep up with the rest of our navy, while respecting the post-war naval treaties."
 ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "Improved construction methods and more specialized systems like deck edge elevators allow these carriers to transport more planes more efficiently."
