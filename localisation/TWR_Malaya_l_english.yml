 MAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Malaya had thought the British incapable of staying beyond the immediate post-war period: their armies shattered, their economy stagnant, their men unwilling, the British seemed on the cusp of withdrawal. Evidently, this was not the case, with daily Royal Army patrols reminding them of their hubris. With ongoing communist unrest and rising Malay nationalism, Malaya yearns for its independence, and they will have nothing less."

 malayachinpeng.1.t:0 "COMMUNIST SABOTEUR WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE!"
 malayachinpeng.1.d:0 "During the war militias sprang up like wildfire to combat the brutal Japanese occupation of the Malay states, and they know the land and its endless rolling forests like the back of their hand. But the end of the war has not been kind to them. The Rejimen Askar Wataniah was sponsored by the Sultan of Pahang, performing admirably enough to justify a formal commendation by Lord Mountbatten himself. But peace has only brought poverty and funding cuts; the end of the war has left Malayan industry crippled by port blockages and bombed-out railroads, and sultans' funds do not grow on trees.\n\nYeop Mahidin Md Sharif glares at a table, and the newspaper splayed across its surface. It's his only way out. They're offering 250,000 dollars, and the Rejimen is the only force in the area left to do what needs to be done in an area even the British have abandoned. Kelantan, hotbed of the insurgency. Foreign state, but if the money pays well enough...\n\nThe plan is simple and quick; enlist (or coerce, or intimidate) local guides to lead them to the hideout of Chin Peng, hit it quickly and with overwhelming force, and capture Chin Peng. The band of senior leadership decides to handle it themselves; taking on communists with nothing but rudimentary arms is so foolhardy it's basically suicide in the hands of the less capable.\n\nThe train to Kelantan and the initial planning phase flies by in a blur of time and speeches. The band prepares themselves with light supply gear and armaments, pays the local guide and move on foot towards the hideout. One fire, two fires, three fires; they're here. Chin Peng is here - or he is not."
 malayachinpeng.1.a:0 "Begin the search."
 malayachinpeng.2.t:0 "Chin Peng Escapes!"
 malayachinpeng.2.d:0 "The team fan out, move in, taking care to keep to the shadows and the outlines of the shacks. The hideout seems empty, but Communists are masters at guerilla warfare, and they've all heard too many stories of Japanese soldiers walking into ‘empty' villages and never walking back out. Some of their bodies made it out then, but not enough to matter. Nobody wants to come home a martyr to the war on Communism.\n\nThey close in on the head shack, where actionable intelligence assures them that Chin Peng is living. The windows are cleared, the team files up behind the door - and with gusto the team rushes into the room, making sure to sound and look overwhelming. There's literally nothing that can keep themselves safe from automatic fire save their element of surprise, and with every second it leaks away. One room clear, a second, then a third. Only a final chamber remains, the master bedroom, and they rush in - to find nothing. Chin Peng isn't in the house.\n\nPerplexed, they search the house, then the village, again. Nothing is to be found. Chin Peng and his comrades have fled to parts unknown. Only scattered signs remain to show they were ever there - here a copy of the Little Red Book, there a set of teacups, and a tattered red flag on the roof of one of the houses.\n\nThe team returns to Pahang disappointed. For some in the Rejimen there will be little on the table this harvesting season. For others, Singapore awaits with its bustling industry. One thing is sure: Chin Peng and the money have disappeared, at least for now."
 malayachinpeng.2.a:0 "Disappointing."
 malayachinpeng.3.t:0 "Chin Peng Captured Alive!"
 malayachinpeng.3.d:0 "The village is lightly guarded - it appears that the MCP has left this area unguarded in their complacency. It's a stroke of luck the team badly needs. Yeop Mahidin thanks Allah with a whispered prayer, and lays out the plan of attack for the team. One fire team will infiltrate from the south end of the village, the other from the north, beginning at dawn when the patrols will be lightest and most disoriented from lack of sleep. Both will congregate around the head house, clearing out resistance as they go. Chin Peng is to be captured alive.\n\nThe two teams make their way to the starting points, say brief prayers for the blessing of Allah, and spend a sleepless night waiting for the operation to begin. The seniors have all fought in battles like this, but never against people who are trained in the jungle like they are. It's a dangerous business.\n\nThe dawn comes. Both teams hit the north and south respectively, and move in hard and fast so the MCP guards won't have time to respond. Here and there the occasional gunshot as insurgents are cleared and throughout it all the stifling noises of the Malayan night. The teams meet at the house, clear the windows, brace themselves, and enter. Room to room, quick as lightning, striking like thunder and burning with the fires of the damned, the team hits the MCP members and eliminates them before they can speak.\n\nChin Peng pops out of the room with a pistol and attempts to shoot them, but it's jammed. Two team members quickly take him down, cuffing him with makeshift restraints. As the birds of dawn begin to crow, the leader of the Malayan Emergency, the Kingpin, the Plenipotentiary, is captured. And the reward money is theirs."
 malayachinpeng.3.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 malayachinpeng.4.t:0 "Chin Peng Captured Dead!"
 malayachinpeng.4.d:0 "The village is heavily guarded: Yeop Mahidin curses and begins to plan for an assault that is crippled from the outset with lack of men, arms and ammunition. There are at least 50 members of the MCP in the camp, and it appears recent movements have caused some agitation: patrols are double the normal amount, as observed by the local. The assault will hinge on a knife's edge.\n\nEventually, the team settles on a strategy: form a wedge and push into the camp as quickly as they can, using the 2 grenades the team has managed to salvage to create confusion as their assault begins and to escape. They will attack at dawn. Everyone stays wide awake till the dawn, waiting for an operation that is likely to cost some of them their lives: not everyone is coming home from this one.\n\nDawn comes. The assault begins. A grenade is thrown into the camp, and in the chaos of the explosion, the team rushes into the camp in a wedge, firing at the MCP members before they have a chance to react. Gunfire rings out, people scream in the morning wind - and suddenly they're engaged in a firefight. One team member falls, then another. The team draws towards the building, preparing for an assault and extraction.\n\nSuddenly Chin Peng pops his head out of the doorway - with the instinct of practice, the team sharpshooter raises his rifle and fires. Chin Peng staggers back and collapses, missing most of the left side of his skull. Yeop Mahidin curses and calls his men to take the body and retreat: the Government wanted him alive, and they are unlikely to be generous with a group of men offering a corpse."
 malayachinpeng.4.a:0 "Well. What's done is done."
 malayachinpeng.5.t:0 "Extraordinary Valor!"
 malayachinpeng.5.d:0 "It's a humid day in Singapore, which is normal for the city. But the Crown Colony has spared no expenses in time or human endurance in putting up this parade: the Rejimen has, after all, achieved the impossible in taking Chin Peng away from his Kelantan hideout. The British troops march and salute a Malay regiment for the first time since the end of the war, dressed up in fancy dress uniforms and shining boots.\n\nThe regiment marches to the podium and offers a formal salute. The crowd, comprised of British officials from His Majesty's Government, cheers in relief, much of it genuine. They know that the Rejimen's actions have made them all safer. The reports from Perak demonstrate a noticeable decrease in Communist activity as the structure falls in on itself.\n\nWith a smile the Governor-General places medals upon the necks of Yeop Mahidin and his team, offering perfunctory congratulations on a job well done. The Award of Extraordinary Valor has been created for this express purpose, and it glimmers on the chest. The menace is dead, and Malaya can sleep safe tonight, thanks to them.\n\nOn the way home from the parade the team is accosted by a gang of rowdy young Chinese who accuse them of murdering the Malayan Revolution, but the team fights them off with ease. After all, the head is dead; the body will struggle for a while longer, but only for a while."
 malayachinpeng.5.a:0 "Well done!"

 malayaindependence.1.t:0 "The Conference Begins"
 malayaindependence.1.d:0 "Sir Gerald Templer is, as with all official correspondents, all smiles as he greets the assembled delegates in the crowded meeting-hall. They smile back, for the most part - the collected strength of the Malay political elite from all ends of the political spectrum, the one thing they share is a dubious respect for the colonial administrators they work with.\n\nWell, perhaps respect is a strong word; but business is business, and the delegates have no time to waste on impoliteness.\n\nOnn Jaafar seizes the initiative like the headstrong firebrand he is - he calls for Malayan unity across the board, and reminds them all of their shared goals. \"There is diversity within the greater whole,\" he admits, \"but that does not make us weaker - we must be bold in our fight for unity, for who else will believe in it, if not us?\" The applause is scattered, but convincing.\n\nThen the real struggle begins: the silent Singaporean delegates, predominantly People's Action Party members, watch as Tunku Abdul Rahman carefully words his own response. He calls for a re-examination of what he calls the \"silent colonialism\" of economic dominance in Malaya, and for a rebuilding of the dominance of the Sons of the Soil over their birthright. The Singaporean delegates rebut what they see as a call to \"thinly-disguised ethnocentrism\", and soon the two are locked in deadlock over the definition of nationalism.\n\nTempler steps in, his face brooding, and halts the premature discussion before it can escalate; but it is not a promising sign for the Malayan Independence Convention that unity barely lasted beyond its opening speech."
 malayaindependence.1.a:0 "Perhaps we will need to try harder."
 malayaindependence.2.t:0 "The Multiracial Dilemna"
 malayaindependence.2.d:0 "As the conference grinds on, the erstwhile unity of the Malayans is ground to dust beneath the gears of policy - but the United Front is still a useful theoretical instrument, and as the feuding factions contend under the table they let almost none of it show on the surface.\n\nUntil the issue of ethnic policy comes up, of course. Then everything goes to hell.\n\nJaafar speaks first, when the issue is tabled, and his speech goes in an anticipated direction. Jaafar calls for the unification of the Malayan people \"in substance, not only in spirit\", and demands an end to the \"treasonous\" talk of ethnocentric policy he's heard in the past days. This is, by Western sensibilities, a fairly honest choice. In a country where Chinese dominate the business and financial sectors, and where the bootprints of British colonialism have barely been scuffed out by Japanese tank-treads, it is political suicide.\n\nA broad front forms between Jaafar and the Singaporean delegates in opposition to UMNO, snapping over long-buried tensions now open and lethal. Ethnocentrism is necessary for Malay economic equality or it will lead to an economic dictatorship, and then eventual ruin; language policy will alienate people from the State and it will push them into the orbit of the Nation; the Chinese are vital to Malaya and they are dangerous, unreliable aliens.\n\nThe conference is no longer spiraling into chaos; it has now arrived.\n\nIn the end it is Templer who restores some sense of dignity, calling for a future plebiscite to decide the fate of multiracial policy. Even this motion barely passes, and as the flames begin to crisp, Templer can only pray for something resembling a positive conclusion."
 malayaindependence.2.a:0 "This does not look good."
 malayaindependence.3.t:0 "The Singapore Question"
 malayaindependence.3.d:0 "Harry Lee casts one of his trademark glares around the room, and there is dead silence where his stare lands. He rasps in his trademark Oxford accent: \"Gentlemen, why are we really here?\" In the face of the delegates' continued silence, he continues: \"We are here to decide for ourselves if the Malayan people will receive the self-governance and the dignity they have fought for. In the fair city I represent, that dignity must receive a slightly different form from what we are discussing at present.\"\n\nAnd in the blink of an eye, the air in the room changes. The Malayan delegates cough, a few mutter between themselves. Harry presses on. \"My island - Singapore - is beautiful, and its people are strong and varied, but they are also different from the constituencies my fellows here represent. They possess a far greater percentage of Chinese than the rest of the Peninsula. Our industry is more advanced, our commercial power greater - and yet we are also more fragile, and prone to violence.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, I have said that this Union must be a partnership of equals. I am devoted to the ideal of a Malayan Malaya, where all possess a common desire to work for the greater good - and yet some of the political ideals possessed by the delegates here threaten that equality of position, and would only inflame my fair city to the point of violence. I propose, therefore, a Special Status for Singapore - political autonomy and integration into a Common Market as benefits us both, but without the threat of political oppression.\"\n\nThe room explodes into open gossip. Snarling is heard from the UMNO orthodox delegates, and as several of them rise to speak, Templer kneads his brows. This will be a difficult symphony to weave together."
 malayaindependence.3.a:0 "Let's leave this unanswered for now."
 malayaindependence.4.t:0 "End of the Conference"
 malayaindependence.4.d:0 "The statements given to the paparazzi swarming outside the Parliament House in Kuala Lumpur are, on the surface, positive. Autonomy and full-fledged independence are on their way, and military concessions within the Straits Settlements aside, the Malayan Federation will soon be a fully functional state of its own. The delegates are united, as are the people behind them - the end of centuries of colonial imposition is in sight, and a bright future awaits just behind the clouds!\n\nThat is what the statements say. The truth is very different.\n\nThe chaos of the Conference has given rise to widespread cynicism within the delegations of the Settlements, as failure after failure to come to a legitimate consensus on virtually anything breeds toxicity of its own. Embittered racialists call for the destruction of factions they see as impeding the greater cause of fixing racial disparity; the egalitarians of Singapore and Jafaar's clique snarl that racism cannot be fixed with more racist policymaking, and demand a unified response to chauvinism. Singapore-exclusivists believe the situation in the Diamond City is a ticking timebomb, while inclusivists insist that if Malayan law cannot apply equally to all Malayan soil it is worth nothing at all.\n\nThe conference has succeeded beyond its wildest dreams in precisely one thing: delaying the conflict it was meant to solve.\n\nLee Kuan Yew nods to Tunku Abdul Rahman as the two depart from the City Hall. They say nothing, but trade knowing glances. As Lee's taxi to Singapore arrives, Tunku yells something in French to the Oxford lawyer, but it is lost in the sudden wind of a departing plane, and the moment is lost."
 malayaindependence.4.a:0 "After us, then, the flood."
 malayaindependence.5.t:0 "Inauguration Of The New Port"
 malayaindependence.5.d:0 "Jurong, in truth, is a land widely considered to be almost the most worthless on the island of Singapore: it is good for nothing but malaria, chicken-farming and attap houses. Indeed, the rapidly modernizing city has mostly left Jurong untouched, considering it almost unusable for anything except housing, or possibly commercial amusements like a bird-park.\n\nBut times change, and there are new plans for this untouched expanse of tropical hills: the biggest sign of this is the glittering new structure that has arisen from the coast of the Jurong Islands, in gleaming steel girders and concrete piers and wharfs. Lights flare long into the night as the work goes on, arc-fire luring in predators and prey alike. Several are almost killed when a boar in heat scrambles into the construction site, nearly goring a couple of defenseless workers before it is shot.\n\nAs the scaffolding falls away, the Legislative Assembly takes a walk around the Port, noting the refined standards of the container bays. It is said that this new port will be capable of managing almost forty percent of the established Keppel Harbor's volume of tonnage, and seventy percent of its ship-capacity. There were initial plans for something far greater, but the building was rushed and sacrifices had to be made.\n\nEven so, the Representative for Singapore notes, there is much to be proud of here. It has taken months of backbreaking labour even to produce a close replicate to Keppel; and this is only the beginning. There are plans to expand it using the power of simple sand and soil, moving the earth itself to expand Jurong Port into the sea around it.\n\nA vessel moves to dock, sirens blaring faintly, and the Representative smiles. It is time for history to begin in Jurong Town - and as with the rest of Singapore, this history will begin on the back of offloading coolies."
 malayaindependence.5.a:0 "A power move for the beautiful island."
 malayaindependence.6.t:0 "Ties With The PAP"
 malayaindependence.6.d:0 "Onn Bin Jaafar smiles and pats Harry Lee on the back, as the delegates assembled around them cheer. If the PAP came looking for allies, it has most definitely found them in Jaafar's men, and a powerful new bloc of racial and ethnic egalitarianism has emerged from the meeting of the two. Already the party is beginning to discuss, in gluts of gossip and whispering, the plan to seize Malayan politics by the neck - and not let go, until the spectre of ethnocentrism is purged.\n\nLee, ever the pragmatist, seeks to temper expectations in his closing remarks. \"I thank the assembled delegates, and the esteemed Mr Onn, for their loyalty and fervor for our common cause. But let us not pretend that the war before us is won by this temporary victory.\" He glares around the conference hall. \"There is plenty of work to be done, and UMNO stands like a monolith before us, ready at any opportunity to rebuild inequity upon inequity." Jaafar nods. Even now, there is no guarantee that this united bloc will last the year.\n\nBut there is also reason for hope, something which Jaafar himself emphasizes in his closing remarks: the two parties will now fight for the same, egalitarian stance on Chinese relations and an end to Bumiputra chauvinism. There will be no need for umbrella parties, no need to build walls between already alien peoples; instead work will begin to tear them down and forge a lasting national community where there was none.\n\nAs Jaafar concludes, he raises a toast to Harry Lee, and to the assembled hopefuls; \"Let the world we build be better than the old!\" The joyful noise echoes far beyond the room's confines, and whispers of it begin to leak, slowly but surely, into the rest of Malayan society."
 malayaindependence.6.a:0 "Let us hope for new beginnings."
 malayaindependence.7.t:0 "Ties With The PAP"
 malayaindependence.7.d:0 "Harry Lee's face is one of barely repressed distaste, but it scarcely matters to the Tunku: only the handshake he offers matters, and the Tunku gladly accepts it. The two are surrounded by UMNO and PAP delegates, herded together like sheep in that crowded conference hall; scattered applause breaks out, but the conversation is cold and formal. These men are now allies, but they will never be partners.\n\nHarry has few words to offer, for once in his career. \"Let us not waste time,\" he reminds the audience. \"This armistice buys us time to build a nation together, and to preserve its essential traits. We must not squander it in the pursuit of further conflict.\" Tunku raises an eye at the careful avoidance of the main agreement, but nods. There is no harm in being magnanimous, not now. \n\nIn any case, the Tunku has won, and in his own remarks he makes sure all of them know it. There will be no change to ethnic policy, not on the Malayan side of the Straits of Johore; only Singapore will be free to implement its own ethnic policymaking, and the PAP will never attempt an intrusion on Malayan electoral politics to change that. It is the best the Tunku could have hoped for, and it will surely preserve the balance that the Malay chauvinists have struggled for.\n\nHarry simply nods, his malice buried like a sheathed knife, and rises to leave. The matters of Singapore, even now, must be attended to - this embarrassment of a settlement will surely rankle on him for some time to come. As he leaves, Tunku calls to him, \"Good luck running your city, Lee!\" Harry, barely even looking back, simply says:"
 malayaindependence.7.a:0 "I have given up my beliefs to keep it."
 malayaindependence.8.t:0 "PAP Antagonized"
 malayaindependence.8.d:0 "Relations between the political parties UMNO and PAP have reached a new all time low, native Malays in support of UMNO have repeatedly attacked the Chinese immigrant population and PAP institutions. UMNO politicians claim that the reason for the attack was that they have been oppressed by the PAP for far too long and that they won't take it any longer. Lee Kuan Yew has denounced these attacks as \"a yet unseen form of terrorism against the Chinese population.\" It is yet unknown if the PAP will retaliate with similar matters.\n\nThe racial tensions between the Malays and Chinese had been rising for a while in Malaya, and it seems unlikely that the two parties will make some sort of peace or truce. The relations between these two parties will only become worse in the future."
 malayaindependence.8.a:0 " So much for a \"peaceful\" Malaya."
 malayaindependence.9.t:0 "Fixing Futures, Building Hopes"
 malayaindependence.9.d:0 "Residents of Negeri Sembilan will point to Chili Padi as their condiment of choice in, well, nearly every dish, and overwhelming dollops of the stuff are usual even for roadside fare. And so it is natural that in a state-wide celebration conducted at the personal expense of the Sultan, Chili Padi predominates; as the Sultan thanks the British Resident for the support of the Crown in expelling the Communist threat, said Resident (recently-arrived) nearly chokes on dishes he can barely taste through tears. Scenes like this are repeated across the Federated Malay States, whose recent turmoil is at last coming to an end, as its people celebrate the return to peace.\n\nAs the last cells are dragged into prison or shot behind government buildings, there is talk of renewed British and American investment in infrastructure and education - but the air is different, and heady, and too many in Kuala Lumpur have smelt it to let it be comfortably ignored. Rumors come of an accelerated schedule for independence, and the Malay people are fast to note that an Organization built for the sole purpose of anti-Communism is by definition defunct in the absence of Communism. Which means… no one can say yet, but in the long-tepid air hope is beginning to stir."
 malayaindependence.9.a:0 "May the lands of the Sultans march into the future together!"
 malayaindependence.10.t:0 "Swaying In The Rubber Breeze"
 malayaindependence.10.d:0 "The first thing rubber farmers will tell you is how much the business stinks: rubber, once bled from a tree, begins to produce a scent that only grows stronger with coagulation. It fumes up the air and it chokes the rivers downstream, making the most concentrated parts of Johore's booming rubber industry a sensory hell. With the rise of the Communist threat the Rubber Breeze died to a faint whiff, but now the former is gone, it is back with a vengeance. Residents threaten to move to more pleasant states in angry letters written to helpless town councils, as the rubber industry continues its expansion into Johore's rich forests and topsoil.\n\nBut the odor of business is not the only one caught on the breeze as the plantations slip into full-scale operations. Chin Peng's troops ran amok in the jungles, many of them from the island bordering them, carrying rifles and propaganda straight from the docks at Keppel. Rumors of Singaporean complacency and infiltration merge into a generalised suspicion for their brothers across the Straits, and worries abound about the high Chinese population of Johore's main external exporter. If Singapore is still an area of suspicion, perhaps… eyes are raised to Kuala Lumpur, and beyond. Johore is free of Communists now, and perhaps it is time to seek to be free - forever."
 malayaindependence.10.a:0 "Strange hopes on wild breezes."
 malayaindependence.11.t:0 "Swaying In The Rubber Breeze"
 malayaindependence.11.d:0 "Kedah's ties to rice are as old as its ties to the world. Its bountiful rice paddies have fed the rest of Malaya since the days of the old Sultans and the kings before them, when Kedah was a power in its own right; but the Red Terror threatened to cut that supply line as the Communists razed roads, detonated explosives on railways and killed merchants and plantation owners in their homes. Crops rotted in the fields, trucks sat unused on estates too dangerous to cross at night. But now the threat is over, and the Rice Bowl of Malaya is safe again.\n\nAs railways are repaired and the growl of traffic hits the highways anew, the same talk infecting the rest of Malaya hits the Sultanate. Thai Traders from across the border speak glowingly of their kingdom, unstable and occasionally chaotic but proudly unbowed to any other power in the world. And rumors from India abound in the ports as the fractious peoples of the Ganges build their own versions of the future with hands that are free once again. Kedah is an exporter of rice, but it is an importer of ideas: and these ideas are interesting enough to warrant further consideration. For now, Langkawi slumbers. For now."
 malayaindependence.11.a:0 "Kedah is free!"
 malayaindependence.12.t:0 "Kelantan Rebuilds"
 malayaindependence.12.d:0 "Some of the first things the Communists took from Kelantan were the temples. Kelantan's rich ethnic diversity encouraged the growth of a few Thai-styled Buddhist temples and more than a few richly decorated mosques in the style of the Thais. Chin Peng despised them, calling them reactionary bourgeois architecture, and so the first months of Communist insurgency were marked by regular explosions as temples and mosques went up in smoke to the horror of watching communities. Now the Communists are gone, and slowly the people of Kelantan are rebuilding, brick by brick, what Chin Peng took from them.\n\nOf course, this is not the only thing that must be rebuilt; industry, infrastructure, agriculture, everything was burnt in the final destructive hours of the Red Dawn. But some things are lost forever. The tolerance and trust that held sway between Thai, Chinese, Malay and Indian will never be the same again, and it will take a long time to restore a sense of normalcy. Above this is a sense of disillusionment at the British for allowing the Communist threat to take root in the first place. Perhaps the fate of Malaya is best given unto the Malays - and no one else."
 malayaindependence.12.a:0 "Home of insurgency no longer."
 malayaindependence.13.t:0 "The First Election"
 malayaindependence.13.d:0 "Kuala Lumpur is often said to be a sequestered city, a capital defined by its sharp divisions between ethnicity and economic class. The Malays, Indians and Chinese here, it is said, vote the same way they buy and sell: the Malays call each other brothers, the Indians calculate, the Chinese haggle and snap, and all stay far away from each other. This week has been a resounding repudiation of this message -this week, everyone in Kuala Lumpur is suffering together.\n\nThe main divide, between the IMP and UMNO, is of course a racial one. Here Onn's egalitarians and UMNO's ethnocentrists have come to blows in their fury - one views the other as traitors to the race or nation, and there are scattered reports of violence in the streets over political rallies. A religious gathering in the Indian community has been cancelled over threats of a carside bomb, and for the first time since the Occupation districts in the city centre are under lockdown.\n\nThe violence extends beyond mere race. The coming election has stirred up deep resentment within racial communities - the Chinese and their Peranakan elite, the Malays and their elite classes, the Indians and the merchants who always seem to make more money than the rest combined. And in the middle of it all, the Singaporeans: letters to newspapers act as fire to the fuel, denouncing the Chinese of Singapore as irritants, Communist rabble-rousers, parasites. Refugees. One night a businessman from that sunken city is stabbed in a cafe near the Lake Gardens. His killer is never found.\n\nAs the awful week draws to a head, Malayans hold their noses and vote. There can only be one Malaya - and there can be only one party to realise its dreams."

 malayaindependence.14.d:0 "Journalists attending the victory rally of the first Prime Minister of Malaya are the first to note a radical change in atmosphere: throughout election season, rallies were usually held on heavily ethnic grounds. Rallies were mostly Malay, mostly Chinese or mostly Indian, and never a mix of any of the three. Now, however, Jaafar makes sure that his first real public speech is made to all - not for any given community, but for the nation as a whole.\n\nLooking out upon the cheering crowds, as commentators note, the Malayan people appear to have gotten the message.\n\nOnn has never been one to shy away from controversy, and he makes his position blindingly clear: there will be an end to the proposed ethnocentrism that will lock Chinese and Indians into quota systems in schools. There will be an end to the suppression of the Orang Asli. There will be an end to implicit Malay supremacism, and here Onn minces no words when he refers to the institutionalised racism of the latter as \"no better than the German race-baiters\".\n\nInstead, he emphasizes, all in Malaya will be uplifted by the hand of the State. Just as the Malay farmer will receive government loans to pay for his children's schooling, so too will the Chinese merchant be allowed to keep his son in college - and the Indian soldier will have rights on par with his fellows in freedom of speech, religion and assembly.\n\nTo the cries of chauvinism echoing from the UMNO camp, Onn only raises his hands in protest - and in truth no statement is necessary. The fact that Onn has eroded a decade of Malay politicking in a single election is proof enough that he has secured the Malay voice. It only remains to be seen what he will do with it."

Tunku Abdul-Rahman has won the elections, and the general sense is one of unabashed euphoria, for the Malay-Nationalist movement has always viewed the Tunku as one of its more forthright champions - what is amazing is that no small fraction of the Indian and Chinese communities have shown support for his campaign as well. He is one of those figures rare in Malayan history: a uniquely unifying leader willing to use his reputation for the good of all.\n\nThe Tunku speaks from the podium at Kuala Lumpur, declaring a whole host of freedoms now open to the Malayan nation in one simple word: Merdeka! Independence! With independence comes freedom for the struggling Bumiputera trapped in the poverty cycle sweeping rural Malaya, freedom for the struggling Businessman being outcompeted by foreign firms in London and Calcutta, freedom too for the minorities fearful of discrimination and prejudice (although the Tunku is very clear on the limits of this freedom, and the place all free Indians and Chinese should take besides UMNO for the good of the country). There is much to be done and little time to do it in, but the civil servant is optimistic as befits a man of his vocation. \n\nNot so for others, however. Onn Bin Jaafar and his clique have already issued critical comments slamming the Tunku for not being radical enough to resolve the greater issues confronting the indigenous community. Many Chinese remain worried about the ethnocentric approach UMNO advocates and intends to enshrine in law. The businesses are not all convinced of his proposed nationalisation strategies, and foreign investors write worried letters to local gazettes. Even so, Abdul-Rahman is determined to push forward: the future will not wait for the Malay people, and now more than ever, a future is what Malaya needs."

No, he has held the Ultra dream high through thick and thin, and now that UMNO sits fat and lazy, it is high time to start raking in the fruit of old promises.\n\nA voice, hoarse and clear, rings out. \"Permission to bring a bill to the Table.\" He looks behind him - ah, he thinks.

Starting in Penang, officers fired rock salt, rubber bullets, and nerve gas into crowds of unarmed protestors.\n\nRather than intimidating the natives into submission, the crack-down has only intensified the riots. News has reached the public that numerous civilians have been killed by the MUPF's supposedly non-lethal weaponry, with an estimated 33 civilians having died in Penang alone. The violence has provoked widespread shock and horror from the general public, with even the more politically-moderate Malays condemning the MUPF's behavior.

This is how rebellions are born, after all; flames, gunfire, suffocating haze - and lies. Was it an armed patrol of Malay nationalists out for Chinese blood that met the 5 Chinese guerillas on a road 30 kilometres from Kota Bahru? Was it an innocent gardener, as the Malays and British claim? Or was it an English colonial planter, as a few fleeing the scene will later testify to in reports that are shredded for \"security purposes\"? All are true; none are relevant. What matters is that an argument becomes a fight, and then a shot is fired, and another, and soon gardeners and Chinese and Malays and even a token Englishman lie dead in the lalang grasses, their blood the first offering on the altar of the Emergency. They will not be the last. The second assault on a patrol in Kota Bahru happens in the next 36 hours; on the bloodied corpses of the patrol a letter from the Plenipotentiary himself is found, proclaiming that truth, and Revolution, will soon reach the Malayan people everywhere.

The Federation of Malaya was birthed in the hopes that this little outpost could become a great force for Liberty in Asia, and your support could make the difference between a civilised continent and one fallen to the eternal savagery of the Reds.\n\nSo, to sum up the reports of my Military Commissioner: we are in dire need of manpower for our battalions and equipment for our civilian militias.

Assemblymen struggle with ethnic quotas, overpopulation, endless hunger in the city that is simultaneously too much and never enough, taxation and port revenues, and with the rhythm of their arguments the city itself seems to pulse.\n\nToday that old heartbeat is stilled, and the Assembly silent; in the place of words comes the scribble of a single pen by a British delegate. Gerald Templer nods at the Assemblymen and murmurs words that he doesn't quite mean. Stability. Necessity. Sacrifice, for themselves and for the city surrounding their walls, sacrifices of men and treasures and of ideals pushed ever backwards into some imagined future. As Singapore moves into the open arms of naked Empire, there is no avoiding these unpleasantries, and so Templer is as honest as he can manage.\n\nAbove all, however, the idea that comes up the most is that of confidence. There is a confidence in Templer's voice as he announces that the struggle unfolding on the Peninsula, the nightmare that swallows squads and regiments whole in the night and spits them out in half-chewed gristled lumps - that struggle will end, and the path to prosperity clear. This confidence drowns out the fears and the doubts of the men and women now separated from Malaya's families and traditions, and as Templer leaves there is even scattered applause.\n\nAs Templer cleans up after his lie, he prays that his decision here has not been in vain. Singapore is safe now: but when the troops come home and the jungles return to their endless stillness, will the borders open on a hinterland safe for the Light of the South?"

Even so, formalities must be observed - it is the only thing that separates them from animals, after all.\n\nThe contingent salutes their civilian counterparts and begins the handover with the Malayan guests. It seems almost like an extraordinarily ungainly dance - the representatives march to each other, jerkily move the flags of the British and Malayan Federation about, swap their respective colors, and march away.A final salute marks the end of the ceremony, and with it, Singapore officially rejoins the Malayan Federation as an autonomous city.

The Federated States, while not suffering the same colonial fate as the Strait Settlements, had their hands tied by the British, with the monarchs being forced out of the picture while still holding de jure power. The Federated Malay States, unfortunately, also suffered harshly from both Japanese occupation and the Emergency.

All but Johor were temporarily annexed by Thailand in the Second World War, and all states were somewhat more reluctant to join Malaysia than the Federated States (albeit still fully willing). In order to fully heal from the War and the Emergency, as well as for unity's sake, we will invest money into rebuilding the Unfederated States, as well as sweeping out the communists that still remain and making sure they can never gain a foothold here again."

As part of Program KESBAN, we shall rebuild the Strait Settlements and transform them into modern economic centres for us to enrich ourselves from, on scale with the great cities of America and Britain.

 malaya.200.d:0 "Our plan of hunting down communists in rural areas has lead to many being put in jeopardy, living in the middle of this rural battlefield, their lives are at great risk, do we spend a great deal of our time and resources evacuating these people or do we take the risk?"

 malaya.21.t:0 "The Spark"
 malaya.21.d:0 "The root cause of the riots is simple in hindsight: hatred of the Japanese is possibly the only thing that unites the disparate populations of the Malayan peninsula. Although the Japanese were expelled from their Singaporean positions relatively quickly after the war (an angry and embittered refugee population put paid to any pretence of civility), they remained on the Malayan peninsula in small-scale rubber and agricultural concerns. In the chaos of the post-war economic slump a few Japanese concerns moved back into the Malayan cities to survive, one or two even shifting to Singapore. Nevertheless, the Japanese population is begrudgingly tolerated at best - and in the stress of the endless market many things are lost in translation. \n\nGoodwill is one of the first things to melt away in the stifling heat. The policeman glares at the Japanese businessman, half-soaked in the torrential heat, trying to make his way into the business district in Central Singapore. Suspicious, and didn't the Governor declare an emergency over an illegal intrusion the other month? A dispute over what exactly his massive briefcase contains (future investigation will reveal that it was, in fact, a transistor design straight from Osaka) turns into an argument. Eyes start moving towards the businessman, and with them the gossip: this is déjà vu, isn't it, and what does a Japanese want with them anyway? Doesn't he have a country to rebuild? \n\n Whispers haunt the businessman as he retreats into his hotel, and soon there is a modest crowd, about twenty strong, gathered outside and demanding to see his credentials. The Japanese community here is small but toughened by stress and ostracism, and attempts to extricate the unfortunate Mr. Fujimoto from his distress - this is the spark. As a twenty five-men rescue squad begins to move into the building, a hand is raised in warning, grabbed with improper haste: and the shouting begins. The squad finds themselves locked in the building, barricaded against an enemy now swelling into the hundreds."
 malaya.21.a:0 "Worrying"
 malaya.22.t:0 "The Bonfire"
 malaya.22.d:0 "It is often said that one can tell the strength of a community by the speed by which it rises against itself: by this definition Singapore and Malaya are both divided and united, but now they are united in hatred of a mutual enemy. As the hours pass and police attempt an unsuccessful breaching of the mob to enter the hotel, word spreads like wildfire across the telephone lines and roads of the Straits Settlements, and beyond to the Malayan cities. Funnily enough, the most established area of Japanese presence, the Malayan hinterlands, is mostly unaffected - familiarity breeds contempt, but it also breeds complacency, and the Japanese Farmers are trustworthy enough to be spared the conflagration. \n\nThe mob expands and spills onto the surrounding streets, with rudimentary barricades creating the illusion of a fixed settlement. The Central Business District shuts down. Buses are overturned. Community leaders attempt to rally people who have already begun to get ideas about the Japanese Menace, and are unlikely to listen to further instructions. Japanese homes and businesses, of course, are burnt to the ground. Everyone is waiting for something to set things alight. \n\nAnd then the hotel starts to burn, an errant grenade or explosive or Molotov cocktail making its way into the flammable stores of liquor in the basement. It is, for lack of a better word, a fiasco: police forces buttressed by Army companies (sent far too late due to fears of inflaming the civilian population) fire on the crowds, and by extension on the fleeing civilians escaping the bonfire, as the latter are in turn attacked by blinded and enraged citizens. The hotel collapses at 3:51pm, about 20 hours after the initial incident, and takes with it an estimated 45 tourists (26 of them Japanese) - they join the 67 already dead and wounded, all victims of a catastrophically unfortunate series of events. It is an embarrassment, a travesty of justice. And who knows if it will happen again?"
