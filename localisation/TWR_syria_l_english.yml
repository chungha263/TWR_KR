SYR_Greater_Syrian_Dream:0 "대시리아의 꿈"
SYR_Greater_Syrian_Dream_desc:0 "시리아 국민들의 꿈은 시리아의 자연국경으로 확장하는 것입니다. 시리아는 레반트 강 전역을 강탈당하고 외세에 의해 분열되어 현재와 같은 비참한 상태로 치닫고 있습니다. SSNP는 모든 대시리아를 통일하고 시리아의 위대함이 천 년 동안 지속되도록 하기 위해 노력하고 있습니다."
SYR_Lebanese_Unrest:0 "레바논 소요 사태"
SYR_Lebanese_Unrest_desc:0 "레바논과 시리아, 두 지역 내 이해충돌로 인해 레바논 국민들은 시리아의 일부분으로 취급당하는 것에 대해 분노하고 있어 레바논의 시리아 통치에 대한 반항을 더욱 심화시키고 있습니다. 민족주의 단체들은 더 큰 권한을 얻기 위해 노력하는 반면, 일부는 시리아국으로부터 완전히 분리되어야 한다고 주장합니다."

SYR_Opposition_Parties:0 "지하의 반대세력"
SYR_Opposition_Parties_desc:0 "After the Nazi-backed revolution that overthrew the Republic, Syria under the SSNP outlawed every other political entities and declared them 'Enemies against the state', but failed to destroy them completely, leaving many underground groups advocating for different ideologies, such as the Pan-Arabic moderate Nationalists and Republicans."
SYR_Opposition_Parties_2:0 "사라지지 않은 지하의 반대세력"
SYR_Opposition_Parties_2_desc:0 "Syria has enacted a comprehensive campaign to root out remaining opposition groups within the country, which has been met by some success. However, destroying ideas is much harder than destroying countries or people, and the opposition will always remain under the surface, a thorn in the side to Saadeh's regime."
SYR_Enemies_On_All_Fronts:0 "모든 전선의 적"
SYR_Enemies_On_All_Fronts_desc:0 "Syria is surrounded, with hostile regimes all around us, banding together in an attempt to stop the destiny of the Syrian people. The Syrian Army has been drilled to reclaim and defend Syrian soil for years, and they are ready for the fight when it arrives."
SYR_Oversized_Army:0 "비효율적인 군대"
SYR_Oversized_Army_desc:0 "Under the militaristic government of the SSNP, the Syrian State has expanded its army at a rapid rate, buying weapons from Europe overtly and covertly, despite western attempts to halt the flow. With a massive army, the equipment of the units are disorganised, with different variants of equipment ranging from obselete German equipment to cheaply purchased captured Soviet equipment from the German-Soviet War."
SYR_No_More_Kurdish_Opposition:0 "더 이상의 쿠르드 적대자들은 없다"

twrsyria.0.t:0 "시리아국"
twrsyria.0.d:0 "Nazi Germany has always had few allies outside of Europe since the defeat of Japan, but Syria has certainly been one of them.\n\nBefore the European wars, Syria had been a colony of the French, seized from the dying Ottoman Empire at the end of the First World War. As France was defeated and Britain subdued by the 1940 war, Syria initially remained a colony of the new French State. However, it was not long before the SSNP, led by Antoun Saadeh and inspired by the seemingly successful fascist movements of Europe, conspired to seize power. When the coup did come, it was backed wholeheartedly by both the Germans and Italians, with the French relatively powerless to resist.\n\nSince then, Saadeh has led his new Syrian regime with an iron fist. Crushing dissent of all sorts, Saadeh's ambitions extend not just within Syria's current borders, but towards an idealistic 'Greater Syria' spanning across the Levant, from Suez to Khuzestan. Few take these ambitions seriously, and whether Saadeh will seriously attempt to realise them is an open question. However, as recent history has shown, even the most impossible seeming plans of rapid expansion through war can end up becoming a reality."
twrsyria.0.a:0 "시리아 만세!"
twrsyria.1.t:0 "대시리아 주장"
twrsyria.1.d:0 "It has been decided that, for the Syrian state to survive and thrive, it must expand. The dream of Greater Syria, a pan-Syrian nation spanning across the fertile crescent and the Levant, must be created, by force of arms if necessary, before our glorious state can be complete."
twrsyria.1.a:0 "시리아의 영광을 위하여!"
twrsyria.2.t:0 "Attacking the Hashemite Monarchies"
twrsyria.2.d:0 "Preparations are finally complete. Now is the time that we can strike against the monarchies of Iraq and Jordan, backed by their western imperialist puppet-masters. The dream of Greater Syria can finally begin to be realised!"
twrsyria.2.a:0 "시리아의 영광을 위하여!"
twrsyria.3.t:0 "아랍에서의 승리"
twrsyria.3.d:0 "Our latest conquest has been a success - we have defeated the Saudi Kingdom of Arabia, knocking out a regional rival and uprooting western imperialist influence in the Middle East. Now, comes the question of what to do with it.\n\nUnfortunately, the House of Saud is very well rooted in this region, and there are almost no political figures other than members of the royal family. Therefore, we will install Prince Faisal, a powerful Saudi Prince and claimant to the throne, as a puppet king. In return for our backing, he will grant legitimacy to our hegemony over the region, and give us a cut of the wealth and resources of the Arabian desert."
twrsyria.3.a:0 "완벽해"
twrsyria.4.t:0 "이란에서의 승리"
twrsyria.4.d:0 "We have defeated the Persians on the battlefield and captured their capital Tehran.

The defeated Iranians have no choice but to accept."
twrsyria.4.a:0 "완벽해"
twrsyria.5.t:0 "시리아의 참사"
twrsyria.5.d:0 "Our forces have been comprehensively defeated by the Syrian invaders. We have been pushed back, and even our capital Tehran has fallen to the attackers. With such a disaster, we have no choice but to accept Saadeh's peace terms, ceding the border regions in the west of our country including the oil-rich region of Khuzestan.\n\nFor now, this is a disaster for Iran. We can only hope we can reclaim these lands in the future."
twrsyria.5.a:0 "씁쓸한 평화이군."
twrsyria.6.t:0 "터키에서의 승리"
twrsyria.6.d:0 "Though they attacked us first, we have driven away the Turks and captured their capital Ankara. Now, with our position secured, we can sign a peace with Turkey and seize the border territories we have claimed as part of Greater Syria. With our forces occupying so much of the country, they will have no choice but to accept."
twrsyria.6.a:0 "완벽해"
twrsyria.7.t:0 "시리아의 참사"
twrsyria.7.d:0 "Our forces have been comprehensively defeated by the Syrian invaders. We have been pushed back, and even our capital Ankara has fallen to the enemy. With such a disaster, we have no choice but to accept Saadeh's peace terms, ceding the border regions in the south-east of our country to Syria.\n\nFor now, this is a disaster for Turkey. We can only hope we can reclaim these lands in the future."
twrsyria.7.a:0 "씁쓸한 평화이군."
twrsyria.8.t:0 "시리아의 승리"
twrsyria.8.d:0 "We have defeated the Syrians and crushed Saadeh's brutal and mad regime. Now, the time has come to restore order to the regions he ruled over, as well as asserting our rule.

twrsyria.8.c:0 "Let the Arab nations be"
twrsyria.9.t:0 "Victory Against Middle East"
twrsyria.9.d:0 "We have defeated the enemies Eastward and crushed their brutal and mad regime. Now, the time has come to restore order to the regions he ruled over, as well as asserting our rule. We must create the new order in the Middle East, while at the same time asserting Iran's position as the new guardian of order."
twrsyria.9.a:0 "'Liberate' the Arabs from themselves."

twrsyria.10.t:0 "Return Syrian Territories"
twrsyria.10.d:0 "Now that Saadeh has been toppled and a sane regime has been installed in the new Syrian Republic, we have the opportunity to return territories in Syria that we occupy. Should we do so?"
twrsyria.10.a:0 "Return the Territories"
twrsyria.10.b:0 "Maintain our occupation"
twrsyria.11.t:0 "War with Syria lost"
twrsyria.11.d:0 "Unfortunately, our inability to defeat the Syrians in a timely manner has lead to our political leaders accepting defeat. Kuwait is lost."
twrsyria.11.a:0 "No!"
twrsyria.12.t:0 "Victory Over Britain"

SYR_Pressing_the_Southern_Claims_desc:0 "The first step in achieving our national dream is a southward expansion.

SYR_Testing_the_British:0 "영국에 대한 실험"
