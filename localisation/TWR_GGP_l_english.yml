 GGP_The_Civil_Administration:0 "The Civil Administration"
 GGP_The_Civil_Administration_desc:0 "It's important to remember that we're on a civilizing mission in a foreign land. While the military might of the German garrison is unquestioned for now, we shouldn't neglect the civil administrative side of the Generalgouvernement."
 GGP_Franks_Dictatorship:0 "Frank's Dictatorship"
 GGP_Franks_Dictatorship_desc:0 "Hans Frank's legal expertise means that he's a more cautious and reserved decision-maker than most in the NSDAP. If the Reich home office were to vest more power in his office, he can be trusted not to misuse it."
 GGP_Invite_the_Conglomerates:0 "Invite the Conglomerates"
 GGP_Invite_the_Conglomerates_desc:0 "It would greatly benefit the colonial economy if a firm like Krupp or Siemens invested more heavily in the region's industry. Let's reach out to agents from these companies to see if any of them would be interested in financing a business venture or two."
 GGP_Attract_German_Settlers:0 "Attract German Settlers"
 GGP_Attract_German_Settlers_desc:0 "The wild Polish frontier will become less wild and Polish the more Germanized it gets. What are some ways we could attract more settlers from metropolitan Germany?"
 GGP_Brave_New_World:0 "Brave New World"
 GGP_Brave_New_World_desc:0 "We need to stop thinking of the Generalgouvernement as a separate entity from the broader Reich. While the job isn't quite finished yet, eventually the region will be predominantly Aryan. The efforts to integrate the region with metropolitan Germany ought to be stepped up."
 GGP_Reform_the_Administration:0 "Reform the Administration"
 GGP_Reform_the_Administration_desc:0 "We've known for a while that a certain amount of corruption and inefficiency plagues the regional administration. If we want to be better colonizers, we need to be more disciplined when it comes to such impropriety. Some reform is in order. As proud Aryan men, we ought to run a tighter ship."
 GGP_Establish_German_Colonial_Districts:0 "Establish German Colonial Districts"
 GGP_Establish_German_Colonial_Districts_desc:0 "It's been suggested for years that more power should be placed in the hands of local settler governments. Perhaps it's time for a top-down reorganisation of settled land. Only ethnic Germans have full citizenship, so we'll divide the region along racial lines."
 GGP_Expand_the_Agriculture_Sectors:0 "Expand the Agriculture Sectors"
 GGP_Expand_the_Agriculture_Sectors_desc:0 "Our analysts suggest that we could attain a 7.0% higher barley yields if our slaves' working hours were extended. While it may cause them personal discomfort to have less leisure time, they should understand that the Reich is relying on the Generalgouvernment's agricultural output."
 GGP_Establish_the_Polnische_Justizpolizei:0 "Establish the Polnische Justizpolizei"
 GGP_Establish_the_Polnische_Justizpolizei_desc:0 "The Poles are an unruly and irritable race. Controlling them has never been easy, so maybe it would be in our best interest to tap certain Poles to keep their fellows in line."
 GGP_The_Native_Tax:0 "The Native Tax"
 GGP_The_Native_Tax_desc:0 "We need more money to fund our various operations in the region. Seeing as we don't want to put a dent in the prosperity of our settlers, we should raise taxes on natives. Our financial advisors suggest we could still squeeze a little more revenue out of the native population if we tightened our grip."
 GGP_Attract_Nordic_Settlers:0 "Attract Nordic Settlers"
 GGP_Attract_Nordic_Settlers_desc:0 "While we would prefer German settlers first and foremost, we shouldn't turn down lesser Aryans from the Nordic countries. If there are any committed Nazis in Scandinavia who'd like to homestead the Polish frontier, there's no reason for us to turn them away."
 GGP_German_Civil_War:0 "German Civil War"
 GGP_German_Civil_War_desc:0 "It's been an open secret for years that the Generalgouvernement is deeply unstable, even by the low standards of the other RK's. The death of Hitler is putting the state's fragile infrastructure to the ultimate test. We are severely ill-equipped to deal with Witold Pileki and his massive popular uprising."
 GGP_Conscript_the_Security_Forces:0 "Conscript the Security Forces"
 GGP_Conscript_the_Security_Forces_desc:0 "We need more bodies to throw at the rebels. We could press the security forces into full military service to give us a slight edge. It's not much of an advantage, but it's better than nothing."
 GGP_Support_the_Righful_Government:0 "Support the Rightful Government"
 GGP_Support_the_Righful_Government_desc:0 "It's disgusting that so many usurpers are jockeying for control of the Reich. The fuhrer's body is just now getting cold and the vultures are already picking at the remains of the nation he built. We owe it to his memory to support the so-called "rightful government" in this struggle."
 GGP_Protect_Our_Neutrality:0 "Protect Our Neutrality"
 GGP_Protect_Our_Neutrality_desc:0 "In the interest of maintaining stability, we ought to make it known that the Generalgouvernement will remain neutral in this conflict. We have enough problems as it is. The native insurrection poses an existential threat to our power. What we don't need is another front to fight on."
 GGP_Empower_the_Government:0 "Empower the Government"
 GGP_Empower_the_Government_desc:0 "We can't expect much aid from the home office in this fight. As such, we'll have to operate semi-autonomously for the future with minimal external support. It'd be nice if we could make this change under better circumstances, but necessity demands that we act at once."
 GGP_Maintain_Basic_Functions:0 "Maintain Basic Functions"
 GGP_Maintain_Basic_Functions_desc:0 "It's of the utmost importance that we try to preserve the status quo at least a little. We won't be operating at full efficiency (far from it) but our government will survive for the foreseeable future. If we play our cards right, we can limp along towards an uncertain future instead of collapsing completely."
 GGP_Combat_the_Polish_Resistance:0 "Combat the Polish Resistance"
 GGP_Combat_the_Polish_Resistance_desc:0 "The rebels are ruthless. If they successfully overthrow our government, there will be no mercy for the settlers. We have to be worse than them if we want the will of the Aryan people to prevail."
 GGP_Hold_Warschau:0 "Hold Warschau!"
 GGP_Hold_Warschau_desc:0 "We cannot let Warschau fall to the rebels under any circumstances. If Warschau goes, Krakau will be next. These are the two biggest cities we still decisively control… for now. We need to prepare the defenses at once for the impending sieges."
 GGP_Fight_Fire_with_Fire:0 "Fight Fire with  Fire"
 GGP_Fight_Fire_with_Fire_desc:0 "We will make sure that the Subhumans get nothing from us even after we die! We will burn everything and salt the land until we either win or perish!"
 GGP_Promise_Death_to_Rebels:0 "Promise Death to Rebels"
 GGP_Promise_Death_to_Rebels_desc:0 "We need to be as hard on the rebels as possible. Any native suspected of harboring pro-resistance sympathies has forfeited their right to live. Treasonous thought and behavior will be punished by death without trial."
 GGP_Virus_Warfare:0 "Virus Warfare"
 GGP_Virus_Warfare_desc:0 "We are losing and we're losing quite badly. Drastic times call for drastic measures. We have many biological weapons on-hand that were concocted in concentration camp labs across Polen. Many in our administration have been hesitant to cross this line, but this is a matter of life or death for our administration. The natives can't resist us if they're too sick to shoulder a rifle."
 GGP_Promise_Polish_Autonomy:0 "Promise Polish Autonomy"
 GGP_Promise_Polish_Autonomy_desc:0 "Much to the chagrin of the more conservative officials in our government, we've decided to offer individual natives greater rights and autonomy if they side with us against the rebels. They still won't have full citizenship but they'll live better than they have since the 1939 invasion."
 GGP_The_Polish_Volunteers:0 "The Polish Volunteers"
 GGP_The_Polish_Volunteers_desc:0 "The Polish volunteers we've acquired are going to be organized into native brigades, which will be attached to garrison forces and assigned to anti-partisan duties. Although it's drawn bitter grumbling from many settlers, they understand that the future of the Generalgouvernement hinges on how much manpower we can marshal. These collaborator forces may just give us the edge we need to pull through."
 GGP_Our_Last_Stand:0 "Our Last Stand"
 GGP_Our_Last_Stand_desc:0 "No quarter. No retreat. No surrender."
