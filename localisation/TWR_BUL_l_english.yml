 ##Leader Descs##
 BUL_LEADER_Mihailov:0 "Ivan Mihailov's career reads like a travelogue of the Balkans: where the Bulgarian Nationalist Movement stayed in the confines of home territory, Mihailov's best work has been elsewhere in the Balkans, furthering national interests by means which would generally be considered a form of state terror. His domestic popularity boosted by his foreign endeavours and Long career, Ivan now sits at the top of the Bulgarian nation. A terrorist he might have been, but it cannot be denied that his methods have been effective - and Mihailov is as capable of waging peace as he is at waging war. \n\nMihailov's life is intertwined with the Organization he helped found, IMRO; the latter left a trail of murder and carnage across Macedonia and Serbia in the 1920s and 1930s, with the former working in the shadows to clean up the bloodwork. Kings, ministers, diplomats, and common people fell in the hundreds and thousands in the interests of the Bulgarian nation and the preservation of its people. Some of those casualties came from internal factions opposed to Mihailov's presence. After IMRO ceased operations Ivan moved from Turkey to Macedonia and back again, eventually settling in the Ohrana militia and political movement. \n\nMihailov split from the Ohrana in 1945 (he remains friends with its leadership, including Kalchev), but his years in the movement have taught him a valuable lesson. Fascism is vital, but its divisiveness also makes it vulnerable - to survive, Mikhailov believes, the Bulgarian state must reform along pre-determined lines. Paramount to this reform is the security of the Balkans, and so the man known as the Ambassador Of Knives has unveiled a final plan for the region around him, to gather the Balkans in a tight embrace around Sofia as the core rebuilds itself. Resettlement, economic reorganisation, rebirth. No one can claim Mihailov is not ruthless, but no one can deny the size of his dreams."
 BUL_LEADER_Kalchev:0 "Andon Kalchev has been accused of letting his acquaintances define his existence, a claim he fights at every turn: by far the most controversial acquaintance of his has been his collaboration with Italy and his increasingly dogged assertion that Italian fascism fits Bulgaria like a glove. Whether this assertion is true or false, it is undeniable that Kalchev is on very good terms with the neighbour across the Adriatic, and that his militias and government are increasingly defined by Italian advisors and training. Only a fool would ignore friends of the powerful - especially friends in powerful places themselves. And Andon now has the highest place in Bulgaria. \n\nA product of the diaspora of the Bulgarians across the Balkan states, the Bulgarian-by-blood returned to his homeland in the wake of Greek persecution. He quickly established himself as a leading military officer of considerable promise in the 1940s, leading military assistance ventures in collaboration with Italian and German forces in Greece and Bulgarization efforts in Bulgaria-occupied territories to be integrated into the new state. His mixed successes leading anti-Jewish cleanups in the Ohrana he helped found only led him to a position of greater reliance on the Italians for aid, advice and military backup, a connection that both parties have maintained over the postbellum years. \n\nKalchev plans for a great modernization, a state-led reform of local industry and a slow assimilation of periphery peoples into the State after the Italian model - but most ambitious of all is his plan to turn Bulgaria into a true Jewel of the Balkans through a massive increase in service-industry infrastructure. Most of the visitors he plans to attract will be Italian, which only adds to the suspicion of his critics. Even so, Kalchev is determined that his plans will work, and that Italian friendship can only benefit Bulgaria. After all, it's not like Italy will ever falter in its current strengths..."
 BUL_LEADER_Alexander:0 "Even in the halls of the UBNF Alexander Belev is a controversial figure: they call him a collaborator-in-training, a German half-breed, even a double-agent in service to the Hitlerites. Belev has always shrugged these complaints off in public, but it is certainly uncanny how his enemies and his methods of disposing of said enemies invariably seem to coincide with those of the Germans. Nevertheless, Belev has managed to work his way to the highest office in Bulgaria, and radical plans have been unveiled to reform the blood and soil of Bulgaria. \n\nBelev, born to an Italian Dalmatian, was dogged by accusations of Jewish ancestry in his youth: his entire life has been an extended struggle against this accusation, and like most Fascists Belev is adept at defining himself in violent opposition to what he is not. In the Ministry of the Interior, Belev studied under Petra Grabowski, the pre-eminent Anti-Semite of the Bulgarian cabinet. In 1941 he began plans to introduce the Nuremberg Laws into Bulgaria, becoming a member of the SS in the process for his swift action in pushing it through the legislative chambers. He also leads the Ratniks, an organisation that has grown to a position of power and suspicion through their loyalty to the Orthodox Church and a hatred of Jews. \n\nBelev now believes that the Bulgarians are descended from Aryan intermarriage with the Southern Slavs, a marriage of Aryan racial superiority with the strength and solidarity of the Slavic people. He intends to preserve this ethnic blend through additional laws imposed on minorities, but by far his most innovative theories have concerned the Ukrainians, who are apparently descended from the same root stock as the Bulgarian people. If only language and tradition keeps a people apart, then the solution must be to destroy the barrier by the sword, to shape the two halves into a single whole by fire and fury - and Belev has no lack of either."

 BUL_Expand_Executive_Power_desc:0 "Many vultures are circling our beloved Bulgarian lands in these trying years, from the enemies abroad that are the talons of the German and Italian Eagle or the prospect of a reborn Russian bear, to the subversive elements at home that are attempting to subserve us to the decadence and weakness of the past. What Bulgaria needs in these trying times is a strong hand to save her from the horrors afar and most importantly herself..."
 BUL_Formalie_the_Greyshirts:0 "Formalize the Greyshirts"
 BUL_Formalie_the_Greyshirts_desc:0 "The greyshirts served valiantly as the frontline in our first, feeble phase back when the idea of Fascism in Bulgaria was thought almost impossible, and the crushing anvil that ultimately smoldered our many enemies to bits once we emerged triumphant at last. Yet, like always a special status breeds degeneracy and over the years it seems the greyshirts have lost their edge, become disorganized and privy to infighting. It is time to change that and forge them anew."
 BUL_Silence_the_Socialist_Opposition:0 "Silence the Socialist Revolutionaries"
 BUL_Silence_the_Socialist_Opposition_desc:0 "The failure and utter defeat of Marx's fever dream should be apparent to any that watched the brains of the German Spartacists being splattered under the boot of the brownshirts, the total defeat of Mao in the Chinese civil war or the fracture of the Soviet Union. However in our glorious state, for some reason this foolhardy ideology still persists, and even more curious our past attempts at rooting them out seems to have only bolstered their ranks. Now, at last this charade ends for good."
 BUL_Execute_the_Revolutionaries:0 "Destroy the Opposition"
 BUL_Execute_the_Revolutionaries_desc:0 "Even after a decade in power, victory in wars and the greatness of our system proven to all, some still stubbornly refuse to recognise the legitimacy of their new leadership and continue to call for more rights and for corrupt, western-style democracy. While before, fear of uprising held us back, we are now confident that our government is strong enough to weather any kind of dissent, and we should begin the task of rooting out the opposition once and for all."

 BUL_The_Monarchists_Rally_desc:0 "Our worst fears have come to past. In the streets and taverns of Sofia, in the hinterlands of Burgas, at the shores of the Black sea that accursed remnant of yore of Tsarism has not just endured but grown like a tumor. The incompetence of our secret service at this news is staggering and heads will definitely begin to roll there soon, yet despite that many of our high command have been scratching their head at the not just willingness, but explicit wish of the people to return to the weakness and decadence of old..."

 BUL_The_Monarchists_Prevail_desc:0 "Through all the fighting and violence, chaos and disorder, the monarchists have come out victorious. The dangerous fascists have been overthrown, and true government has been restored to Bulgaria. Now begins the task of rebuilding and rehabilitating the country."
 BUL_State_of_Emergency:0 "State of Emergency"
 BUL_State_of_Emergency_desc:0 "Though we have 'won', the country remains in ruins. Isolated outbreaks of violence continues, and fascist sympathisers and other radicals surely lurk in every shadow. For the time being, while the nation is so unstable, a state of emergency must be declared so that we have the powers we need to get to work rebuilding our nation."
 BUL_Repeal_the_Kiril_Act:0 "Repeal the Kiril Act"
 BUL_Repeal_the_Kiril_Act_desc:0 "The Kiril Act, essentially a copy of The Acerbo Law, states that the party gaining the largest share of the votes – provided they had gained at least 25 percent of the votes – is given two thirds of the seats in parliament. This is of course a total democracy or any kind of fair government. This, the basis of the old fascist tyranny, must be repealed immediately."
 BUL_Pernik_Trials:0 "Pernik Trials"
 BUL_Pernik_Trials_desc:0 "As the criminals who drove Bulgaria into chaos, the fascists must be brought to justice. Those we have brought into our custody will be brought to trial in the grandest set of trials this nation has ever had, taking place in the town of Pernik. There, they will be forced to answer for their crimes in front of all the people of Bulgaria. Only then will fascism be stamped out."
 BUL_Stop_Media_Censorship:0 "Stop Media Censorship"
 BUL_Stop_Media_Censorship_desc:0 "During Lukov's dictatorship, the media had been brought under their total control. All dissenting opinion was ruthlessly stamped out, as freedoms of the press and of speech were suppressed. Now, with the fascist regime toppled, it is only right that the people can speak freely once again. Press restrictions will begin the process of being lifted. Censorship shall come to an end."
 BUL_Root_out_Fascist_Elements:0 "Root out Fascist Elements"
 BUL_Root_out_Fascist_Elements_desc:0 "As well as the leaders, it is undoubtable that many, many others were willing accomplices. Serving as goons to the fascist criminals, they enforced the unjust rule of the tyrants. It is clear fascists, high and low, are a threat to the nation. Those that can be found who aided the old regime will be removed from their current social standing. Fascism must be rooted out entirely."
 BUL_A_New_Monarch:0 "A New Monarch?"
 BUL_A_New_Monarch_desc:0 "Bulgaria has had many changes of monarch in recent times. With Simeon's reign now tainted by the fascist regime, some are floating the idea of... 'encouraging' his abdication, in order to install his sister as Marie I. This would form a clean break with the old order, but could at the same time lose us some legitimacy and the support of supporters of Simeon. We will have to decide which way to go."
 BUL_Prepare_the_Election:0 "Prepare the Election"
 BUL_Prepare_the_Election_desc:0 "To prove our legitimacy to the people, constitutional democracy must be restored. We must begin making preparations for the first new elections."
 BUL_A_New_Constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
 BUL_A_New_Constitution_desc:0 "To prove that we are breaking from the old and building a more resilient Bulgarian state, able to resist fascism, we must write a new constitution for the nation, making more clear the constitutional limits of government. The Bulgarian state will be made anew"
 BUL_Allow_Certain_Parties:0 "Allow Certain Parties"
 BUL_Allow_Certain_Parties_desc:0 "Though there is still much worry about extremist elements, to restore democracy and normal political life, we must allow the reformation of old political parties that were destroyed during the Lukov dictatorship.

 BUL_New_and_Improved_Oblasts:0 "New and Improved Oblasts"
 BUL_New_and_Improved_Oblasts_desc:0 "As well as constitutional and political changes, our new government should make changes to local administration too. The Oblasts of Bulgaria will be redrawn to match the modern population and allow for more effective local administration."
 BUL_Meet_with_Partisan_Groups:0 "Meet with Partisan Groups"
 BUL_Meet_with_Partisan_Groups_desc:0 "As the old fascist regime tried to 'Bulgarianise' the non-Bulgarian populations of new territories in Macedonia with a heavy hand, armed partisans rose up against us, leading to continued violence in that region. This pointless fighting must come to an end - we will meet with the partisans, offer concessions of recognition of their autonomy and end the war in the west once and for all."
 BUL_The_Socialist_Question:0 "The Socialist Question"
 BUL_The_Socialist_Question_desc:0 "As all can see, Bulgaria's experience with radical ideologies has, in recent times, been very traumatic. As a result, many are proposing that the radical left, consisting of socialists and even communists, should be barred from elections just as the far right is. This would likely assuage the fears of many of the more conservative members of our coalition, but at the same time we would lose legitimacy and democratic credentials the more we restrict the freedom to participate in elections. A decision one way or another will have to be made before the election comes."
 BUL_Grant_Autonomy_to_Macedonia:0 "Grant Autonomy to Macedonia"
 BUL_Grant_Autonomy_to_Macedonia_desc:0 "Following our negotiations with the Macedonian rebels, we have come to an agreement that the fighting will end if Macedonia is granted autonomy within the country. To end the violence, we will accept these proposals."
 BUL_The_Election:0 "The Election"
 BUL_The_Election_desc:0 "The time has come for the first election in Bulgaria since the fascist takeover. For the first time in recent memory, the people will decide the future direction of our nation! For the Tsar and for Bulgaria!"
 BUL_A_Reformed_Military:0 "Reform the Armed Forces"
 BUL_A_Reformed_Military_desc:0 "The Bulgarian Armed Forces, as they exist now, are a relic of the authoritarian past. As Bulgaria steps forth into a new era under a democratic system and a constitutional monarchy, the armed forces must be brought with it to prevent any future internal conflicts."
 BUL_Reward_Loyal_Officers:0 "Reward Loyal Officers"
 BUL_Reward_Loyal_Officers_desc:0 "Loyal military officers who supported our overthrowing of the fascists are our clear allies. They will be rewarded for their loyalty and promoted to higher positions within the army."
 BUL_Retire_Disloyal_Officers:0 "Retire Disloyal Officers"
 BUL_Retire_Disloyal_Officers_desc:0 "Those officers that show signs of questionable loyalty, on the other hand, are only a danger to our young democracy. They will be quietly 'encouraged' to retire, or moved to less significant positions, to make sure they cannot threaten our new government and institutions."
 BUL_Pledge_To_Constitution:0 "A Pledge to the Constitution"
 BUL_Pledge_To_Constitution_desc:0 "Above all else, soldiers must have loyalty to our great new constitution. All members of the armed forces will be required to pledge total allegiance to it, so the army always fights for the people and their democratic institutions rather than against them."
 BUL_Improve_Training_Standards:0 "Improve Basic Training"
 BUL_Improve_Training_Standards_desc:0 "The bedrock of any army is its discipline and training. After some time of instability, our army has grown disorganised and prone to political infighting. Training, on all levels, must be improved so that our army is once again an effective fighting force."
 BUL_Defend_Our_Gains:0 "Defend Our Gains"
 BUL_Defend_Our_Gains_desc:0 "We have already made significant gains in past wars. Now, it only makes sense for our army to focus on defence to keep what we already have. As we look to improve our land forces, we should concentrate on defensive strategy."
 BUL_Attack_Our_Enemies:0 "Attack Our Enemies"
 BUL_Attack_Our_Enemies_desc:0 "Recent experiences in the wars in Europe has shown that attack is the best form of defence. Going on the offensive and destroying an enemy before they even have the time to react or put up a fight is the way to guarantee victory. As we seek to improve our land forces, we should concentrate on offensive strategy"
 BUL_static_defences:0 "Static Defences"

 BUL_home_advantage:0 "The Home Advantage"
 BUL_home_advantage_desc:0 "One advantage a defending power always has is fighting on its own territory. No invader, however strong or determined, can ever know the terrain, weather and geography of a country as well as those defending it. As we prepare for attacks from our jealous neighbours, we should use our home advantage as much as possible."

 BUL_Infantry_Attack:0 "Shock Infantry"
 BUL_Infantry_Attack_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our economy is not that of an industrial powerhouse and realistically it would be difficult to turn our army into a fully mechanised one.

 BUL_truly_balkan_prussia_desc:0 "The Prussia of the Balkans has been a nickname applied to Bulgaria since the beginning of the century due to our military prowess. However, we have not always lived up to that name successfully, as such events as the Second Balkan War and the First World War showed. Now, however, the modernisation and reorganisation of our armed forces is well underway, and we can once again begin to hold that title honestly and with pride."
 BUL_training_pilots:0 "New Generation of Pilots"

 BUL_into_the_jet_age_desc:0 "The age of propeller driven aircraft is closing - the age of the jet engine is beginning. If we are to have a modern air force fit for the modern world and able to stand up to any foe in the skies, we must embrace this new technology."

 BUL_experimental_helicopters_desc:0 "A new techology, helicopters have limitless potential.

 BUL_supporting_ground_forces:0 "Supporting Ground Forces"
 BUL_supporting_ground_forces_desc:0 "One of the principle advantages that a capable air force provides is the ability for it to support ground forces from the air. Close air support can be decisive in land battles, as the Germans showed during their blitzkrieg across Europe. We should make sure our air force is able to provide the necessary air support to ground forces."
 BUL_upgrade_air_bases:0 "Upgrade Air Bases"
 BUL_upgrade_air_bases_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our network of air bases, like much of our country's infrastructure, is relatively poor. A strong air force needs to the necessary infrastructure to support it, so we must make sure to upgrade our air bases to be able to hold and deploy more aircraft more quickly and efficiently."
 BUL_air_superiority:0 "Air Superiority"
 BUL_air_superiority_desc:0 "The first task of our air force will always be defending our skies from the air forces of attacking enemies. The ability to maintain air superiority over our territory is crucial to its defence, and we should make sure our fighters and interceptors have the crews, training and technology to be able to do so."
 BUL_beginnings_of_modern_airforce:0 "Beginnings of a Modern Air Force"
 BUL_beginnings_of_modern_airforce_desc:0 "Finally, the foundations have been laid for a modern air force. There is still much to do - the full process of creating a powerful air force will take many years - but certainly we have made a good beginning to the necessary work."
 BUL_building_a_navy:0 "Building a Navy"
 BUL_building_a_navy_desc:0 "Bulgaria has never been particularly famed for its naval power, but as the Americans and their allies have shown in past wars, control of the sea can be a powerful asset in war. While we can never hope to match the naval power of the world's superpowers, we can build a capable regional navy to defend and command control of the waters around us and stand toe to toe with other regional powers."
 BUL_expanding_dockyards:0 "Expanding Dockyards"
 BUL_expanding_dockyards_desc:0 "Clearly, before we can have ships and a navy, we must have the necessary facilities to build, maintain and repair them. A programme of dockyard expansion will be launched to expand the existing facilities on our black sea coast and build new ones on the Aegean, allowing us to much more quickly build our new fleet."
 BUL_destroyers:0 "Destroyer Research"
 BUL_destroyers_desc:0 "Destroyers and other lighter vessels form the base of any navy, and particularly that of a smaller, regional power. Relatively cheap and able to patrol the sea surface, while they cannot necessarily fight well against large capital ships, they can nonetheless create a presence on the seas and combat incursions from enemy air and submarine forces."
 BUL_submarines:0 "Submarine Research"
 BUL_submarines_desc:0 "Both the Germans and Americans used submarines significantly, and for good reason. Able to strike from beneath the seas, submarines are perhaps even more useful for smaller countries such as us, nullifying advantages in ship sizes through the use of stealth."
 BUL_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Air Cover"
 BUL_naval_aviation_desc:0 "The awesome power of naval aviation is clear for the world to see. Carriers have surpassed battleships as the rulers of the seas. While building a carrier fleet is likely out of our reach, in waters near our shores, ground-based aircraft can provide air cover and reconaissance for our ships in the sea."
 BUL_controllers_of_bosporus:0 "Controllers of the Bosporus"

 twrbulgaria.1.t:0 "The Riots Begin"
 twrbulgaria.1.d:0 "The Vrana Palace has been described as a triumph of Baroque architecture, and is still studied by architecture students in Sofia as a model for applied aesthetic in estate design - despite the decidedly frosty attitude of the Bulgarian people towards their Regent, their affections for the royal estate are as strong as ever. Being the royal family's permanent residence, access is restricted to high-level officials and official delegations to the Bulgarian state. Not that there are many of either group nowadays: it is said that Regent Kyril is as bad a toastmaster as he is an administrator. \n\nThe crowd marching to the Palace has no intention of playing at niceties over tea, however; waving banners and insignias of the royal crest, they call for the resignation of the Regent and his replacement with the Tsar as the legitimate controller and head of state. Kyril is quite clearly incompetent, and at this point any new leadership would be better than the devil they all know too well. Pitchforks, farming implements, and torches, it's a scene out of the 19th century, if one ignores the occasional pistol or bolt-action rifle held aloft like a ceremonial sword. These people intend to bring Bulgaria back to sense, even if they must bloody their hands to do so. \n\nIt will not be their hands which are stained today, however the UBNF are waiting for them, and in a stroke of luck the Monarchists have arrived just in time to paper over the obvious divides between the various UBNF-aligned militias. Immediately the UBNF attempt to form a cordon, on the orders of their leaders this quickly falls apart as the first Monarchists reach their lines of defense and are quite literally dragged under by waves of angry fascist sympathisers. The few police troops standing guard watch helplessly as mobs of men fling themselves at each other. Fist by fist, tooth by tooth, bloodstream by bloodstream, Bulgaria is saved, or perhaps it is pulled deeper into the fire. From a distance, the two look almost identical."

 twrbulgaria.2.d:0 "When can a nation be said to have been paralyzed? Perhaps a nation only truly stops moving when its people do, when the roads are blocked and the trains grind to a halt for lack of fuel or passage. Perhaps it is when the apparatuses of state stop pumping paperwork into the vast circulatory net of bureaucracy that surrounds the regime. Or perhaps a nation only truly stops when something traumatizes the national consciousness into retreat, when the name of the country or its ruler becomes a matter of hushed silence and painful conversation, as if bearing witness to some intense and raw grief. \n\nThese paralyses have spread thick into the streets of Sofia, choking its smog-ridden winds like a haze that muffles the soul long before it clogs the lungs. The forces who still call themselves the UBNF (although there is little evidence that they are centrally organized, or indeed organized at all) grapple on the streets and in the dining-halls, tearing into loose detachments of monarchist-aligned militias with abandon. Districts switch allegiance twice a week as the roving mobs march in and are forced out by rivals, who are in turn forced out by other gangs. Guns echo hourly round the smoking capital, families hide in cellars or make plans to move in with relatives in the countryside. The police are undermanned, outgunned and overwhelmed. The army has melted away, or it, too, is paralyzed by fear. \n\nThere is a story making the rounds in what is left of the public sphere one night a father wakes up to find his wife kidnapped by the Monarchists. His son joins the Fascists and disappears into the sea of violence, his daughter attempts to flee with her boyfriend and is lost in the wave of refugees streaming out of Sofia, and the father, despairing of it all, is about to hang himself when the letter arrives. His wife is safe - but her family has evaporated. It might not be true, but it rings true, and what does truth matter when the world is falling apart?"

 twrbulgaria.3.d:0 "Sofia's historical centre is a beautiful place at night. Most of the old architecture of the city and its famous cathedrals are concentrated in a stretch of the town where the centuries melt away and time itself seems to dissolve: the Alexander Nevsky stands above the beating heart of Sofia's Orthodox centre, with Neo-Baroque and Neo-Classical architecture creating the illusion of concentric history unfolding on the skylines of posters. In the interbellum period a thriving business built on tourism had raised the eyes and attention of bureaucrats, but with the outbreak of war that faded, and the centre was closed to most civilians, barring the cathedrals. \n\nThey come first bearing the banners of lions and swastikas, bringing the customary bolt-action rifles and pistols and improvised bottles of liquid petroleum. Improvised barricades are set up across the parks and in the pews of the ancient domes. The Pantocrator stands high above in the dome, watching impassively as the walls and pews are stripped for firewood and building material. The few remaining priests beg the militias for reprieve, on God's mercy if not their own, and are laughed off. \n\nOne night another mob bearing royal colors descends on the Centre, and the cheery tones of the day turn to gunfire and confusion. The attack is unexpected and the enemy is everywhere at once, men are cut down by their own in the fusillades. In the chaos one fuel-cocktail is thrown, and then another. Alexander Nevsky is built of wood and plaster. The fire spreads from the altar to the pews and then outside, to the park and its environs. Witnesses report scenes from the pages of the Inferno itself, as soldiers choke on fumes while shooting at enemies they can no longer see; at last, the dome itself collapses, a paint-weeping Christ falling from the heavens into the sea of flame. And a little more of Bulgaria is consumed with it."

 twrbulgaria.4.d:0 "Promiment leader of the far right Ratniks Petar Gabrovski was a man of many sentiments, few of them agreeable, but he died filled with regret. Three days after the national protests started, he expired from malignant cancer of the lungs, watching his country's heart choke on protests as his own filled with tumors. The few functionaries present did not record his private sorrows as he expired, but the death of this evil man leaves the Legions with a problem: who will take care of the Ratniks? After a little squabbling in the UBNF, a candidate is declared: Alexander Belev, fellow antisemite and Legionnaire, will take over Grabovski's responsibilities and announce the transition at the funeral. A potential gravesite is identified not too far from headquarters, and the Ratniks command structure plans a rough procession for the leader's hearse, even as the fires rage unchecked. \n\n On the morning of the funeral, the procession, comprising of an improvised hearse-wagon and a series of ramshackle armored cars, begins its journey. What little spare manpower the Legions can spare is assembled, given unloaded Great War rifles and told to march down the street, a task which they accomplish with great enthusiasm (anything is better than fighting in the great slaughterhouse Sofia has become). All seems well. \n\nThen the improvised bombs go off. Monarchist saboteurs attack at different sites around the city, armed with pistols and handheld implements. The hearse itself goes up in flames as the procession is stormed with a squadron of militiamen, killing many, before they are themselves killed in a hail of gunfire. In an incident which rapidly makes it to the eyes of the national and global press, a desperate Fascist sergeant is photographed interrogating a Monarchist saboteur, pistol pointed at his temple, before pulling the trigger. This image above all else will define the funeral of Petar Grabovski. They will call it the Day of the Scarlet Rain, after the fine mist emanating from the head of the saboteur."

No one sees them, no one hears their approach, but they are everywhere and their grip is tightening over the Jewel of Bulgaria. In the croak of sickly mothers, in the cry of swollen-bellied children, in the quiet sobbing of the cripples and beggars, in the buzz of flies around gutters choked with human waste and remains, Sofia is rotting away. The rot spreads, like any disease, around and through areas already burnt-out by sickness and hollowed out to nothingness: the suburbs, the teeming slums, the Centre, the industrial district. \n\nSoon there will be nothing left of Sofia to fight over. And what is Bulgaria if not Sofia? \n\nThe Army has vacillated between intervention in favor of a faction and simply sweeping the whole apparatus away, Fascists and Monarchists both. Generals assess civilian casualties with grim tones, and everywhere in the camps the Bulgarian Army breaks ranks to plead with superiors to do something, anything at all, about the breakdown. Refugees tell terrible tales and even more terrible silences meet those who dare to ask the bigger questions, what happens when those still alive in Sofia finally run out of food altogether, and where will the refugees go when the surrounding farmland is exhausted? The rest of eastern Europe is little better haven.\n\nAt night the burning city lights up the countryside with its endless flame. It issues gouts of billowed grey smoke, like an addict coughing out the opium-smoke from riddled lungs. Some say one can taste the blood if one sticks one's tongue out far enough. Some say the taste gets a little thicker every day."

The Bulgarian people deserve to be ruled by their hearts and by the one who governs them, not by petty small-arms fire and violent suppression. That sort of treatment is reserved for Bulgaria's enemies. It is a noble and principled stance, and very convenient in times of ideological suspicion. But the conditions that make this neutrality possible are long past, as Sofia finishes burning to the ground - and the jackals who have burnt it down look around for fresh meat. \n\nBoth Fascist and Monarchist sympathisers have sent increasingly hysterical letters about the developing 'situation' in and around Sofia, begging the Army to intervene. These warnings went unheeded for the most part: once the partisans were done squabbling, it was certain that a clear victor would emerge. Who would be responsible for safeguarding the sacred institutions of Bulgaria when that happened? The answer was transparently obvious. And so the Army stood ready and stayed their hand, waiting for the longed-for return to a functioning government (and guarding the borders against any opportunists). \n\nThis certainty has now vanished, as recent reports from refugees report widespread outbreaks of disease, firing squads murdering entire neighbourhoods, and a general loss of civilisation. The situation is reaching unmanageable proportions. The death toll teeters on the brink of the tens of thousands. Sofia descended into violence a month ago, and it has now slipped into a state one could credibly describe as anarchy, even civil war. The General Staff holds a meeting at daybreak, shrouded in a veil of secrecy and fear. All agree on one thing, the time for waiting has passed. The time for action is now. Once the question of which side the army will intervene on behalf of is decided, preparations are rapidly made.\n\nNote: Choices available will depend on the level of support the fascists or opposition each have"

The world dilates like a fish-eye, and it's just the two of us tapping out wild melodies on the broken asphalt. I remember - \n\nI'm five, and she's seven. We're running the gauntlet for breaking the rules of play (girls and boys aren't supposed to hang out together after curfew), trying to move between two rows of friends, and our friends kick and punch with savage glee: but we have a plan. She pushes a girl out of the chain of flailing legs, I grab on to her arm and cling for dear life, and we slam onto the potholed streets of Sofia in a ball of tumbling excitement and clamber to our feet and I notice, for the first time, how bright her eyes shine when she smiles. \n\nI'm twelve, she's fourteen. The bombed out city rushes at us as we dance through the streets, thick with reconstruction and the noise of life. Spices from the markets and the smell of petroleum fumes pool thick in the air as she leads me on, towards a garden they say the ears of the Legions and the Regency informants cannot reach. She dips her head towards me, half-whispers something to me in that lilt of hers, and the world stops around me - \n\nI'm sixteen, she's eighteen, and we're both out of time. The streets run thick with blood and the screams of men lost to the mobs, swastikas and heralds emblazoned on street-poles. Her father is a monarchist, mine a Legionnaire - we are torn screaming from each other, but only the old are foolish enough to think they can stop the hearts of the young. The gardens of our youth become our hiding places, our war-rooms, and there we hatch a plan. Escape. \n\nNow we run, and the world dances around the patter of our feet. We run, and we are free, even in the prison of the dying city."

 twrbulgaria.8.t:0 "The Funeral of Lukov"
 twrbulgaria.8.d:0 "Funerals, like all ceremonies, are half-ritual, half-political manoeuvres: what could be more powerful than the ascension of a leader from a mere mortal to an icon, untouchable and untarnished? Already the speeches are being written about Lukov's brilliance and how his vision will guide the Bulgarian people into a new age (most of these speeches are being drafted by his ardent political rivals and those who wish to take the seat of power from his slowly stiffening corpse, of course, but posterity makes little distinction between genuine and manufactured sentimentality). \n\nAs the few surviving witnesses to the highly embarrassing circumstances of Lukov's death are silenced by members of the Internal Security Branch of the Legions, preparations begin for an elaborate ceremony to legitimize the Bulgarian Fascist presence - the successor to Lukov and the leader of Bulgaria will step into his new post with aplomb. (Police posts across Sofia and the nation at large are under lockdown, the streets under curfew, and domestic intelligentsia are watched daily.) Funnily enough, the inner circle of the UBNF have not been seen together in public since the initial announcement, perhaps they are busy, or…? (The Legions' Internal Security has readied makeshift graves outside major cities for anyone who dares to complete that sentence.) \n\nThe transition will be swift, it will be secure and it will be glorious. The cars arrive and the Inner Circle step out, one by one. (They don't smile to each other.) The hearse is prayed over by the surviving priests of the Orthodox Church (at their insistence), and the coffin of Lukov is sanctified before being moved to his gravesite by mourning Inner Circle members (with carefully controlled sorrow on their faces). The theatre has begun."

 twrbulgaria.9.t:0 "Hristo Lukov Dies!"
 twrbulgaria.9.d:0 "The UBNF woke this morning to find one of its guiding leaders and brightest paramilitary minds dead in his bed. The unfortunate circumstances of Lukov's death were quickly covered up by the state, and almost immediately barred from the general public, for posterity reasons - and also because the scene bore all the hallmarks of sabotage. Lukov died from an extremely quick-acting poison, orally ingested: the evidence points to arsenic. The question of who would dare poison such a prominent Fascist leader is almost too dangerous to answer. It is quite clear that almost everyone in the running for leadership had a clear motive for attempting such a thing, despite red-faced denials, not to mention the many segments of Bulgarian society who despise everything Lukov stood for. \n\nBehind the facade of unity presented by the Legion, the UBNF moves into feverish internal bickering. Faction leaders block the efforts of internal investigative authorities, are accused of murder and in turn attack the others for attempting to pin the blame on the innocent. A half-dozen Socialist and Communist groups take responsibility and are laughed off as ineffectual. All the personnel with him that night are exhaustively cross-examined, and in some cases shot as traitors or suspects. The investigation grinds to a halt just a few days after Lukov's death, realising that whoever killed Lukov will remain shrouded in mystery for want of evidence or suspects. \n\nLukov dies, but there is still the problem of his position. And so the UBNF stops plotting over death, and begins plotting over what happens next."

 twrbulgaria.10.t:0 "The Election"
 twrbulgaria.10.d:0 "Time to bring out the podiums: Bulgaria is voting for its leader. At least, the small fraction of Bulgarian society that is in the Grand Assembly is voting: but according to them they and the Bulgarian nation are one and the same. The Grand Assembly has only voted a few times in its existence, usually on pressing national issues. As a special committee of the National Assembly, it essentially exists as an admission of emergency, which is why its members are so desperate to see it concluded. \n\nThere is no risk of competition from non-Fascist candidates, and the Assembly has itself been stacked with Fascists. Even so, there is a limit to the control a party can exact over its members, and plenty of politicking surrounds the upcoming election. Struggling to deal with the consequences of the previous disturbances in Sofia, several candidates have declared their intentions to regulate UBNF activity. In fact, some Assembly members declare the need to disarm the UBNF altogether. Others dismiss the idea as ridiculous, overreaching and ultimately suicidal to the Organization's activity. \n\nChaos and calm, in alternating intervals, surrounds the candidates in their speeches and comments to the Assembly. Many attempt to question, many are shouted down and ultimately only a few leave happy when the final vote is tabulated. Nevertheless, a decision is reached. A leader is chosen. Bulgaria decides its future, or a variant of it."

 twrbulgaria.11.t:0 "The Assembly Lockdown"
 twrbulgaria.11.d:0 "It's business as usual in the National Assembly. Well, business as usual is a strictly operative phrase: it would be more accurate to call it inaction as usual, especially since the regime's recent moves have caused it to haemorrhage support. Factionalism tends to grow wild where leadership is left wanting - this is amply evident in the barely controlled chaos, as legislators struggle to get their voice heard in the clamor of the crowd. Many are angry these days, on the streets and in the halls of power, and outside the Assembly a crowd has gathered to protest despite the attendant dangers. \n\nMilitary Guards are always present in the Assembly, for security measures and as a nakedly veiled threat against legislators who might think to openly voice dissent against the regime. Their presence is never questioned, even when numbers begin to grow past expected limits: perhaps there is an internal security threat the Assembly is unaware of, it is reasoned, and perhaps the times Bulgaria is living through justify the means necessary to secure the safety of the people therein. And of course the Military must take a seat at the table of power, the gun is the source of all power, as the late Mao Tse-Tung said, so why restrain oneself from recognising the obvious? \n\nSo the coup creeps in unquestioned, a General at a time. When the curtains fall and the soldiers march in there is no one left to resist. At least it is quick, the arrest of the entire Assembly and their replacement, under duress, with a crew of senior military staff is choreographed and meticulous. The Constitution even looks the same as the old one, except in a few places where the line between civilian and military replacement procedures is suddenly absent. Nobody questions it, of course. This is the one rule that governs all plotting."

Ascending to the throne at the age of six, living most of his life under house arrest in the Vrana Palace, but he is heralded by most of the Bulgarian populace, because of the propaganda of the UBNF.\n\nAnd now the question arises: "Shall we enthrone his sister, Marie, to remove the last remnants of the fascist regime and start anew?".

 twrbulgaria.15.d:0 "Economic boom times are a special sort of euphoria, but they are by their very nature, a finite phenomenon. On the 25th of February in the year 1952, the Bulgarian nation came face to face with this fact. \n\nBulgaria enjoyed steady economic growth throughout the latter half of the 1940s. Increased investment in productive capital, young Bulgarians coming out of university, and the economic realignment of the new German Europe all coalesced into strong and steady GDP growth between 1946 and 1950. Unemployment was low, the government was running on a budget surplus for the first time since the war, and our top economic analysts had determined that this growth would carry us through at least 1955. Truly, it seemed as though Bulgaria was going to find its place in the new world order. \n\nBy 1951, those hopes had almost been entirely dashed. The economy stopped growing at the high rates it enjoyed just five years earlier, and it seemed as though the country was due for a localized recession. The volatile political situation in the rest of Europe gave a lot of investors second thoughts, especially as enormous German investments in its newly conquered territories and other states in Europe failed and subsequently dried up, and as Bulgarians began to lose their jobs, more businesses started failing. Some sort of response was needed to prevent a total economic crash, but no competent response ever came, and this Monday, the small Sofia Stock Exchange became silent in its horror. The market had collapsed completely, and this will inevitably have broader effects on the larger economy. God only knows what is to happen to Bulgaria and her people."

 twrbulgaria.16.t:0 "The Grand Trial"
 twrbulgaria.16.d:0 "Up to the podium five men walked, none knew how many would leave. \n\nFirst was the UBNF's leader, the great Vodach Hristo Lukov, his life many agreed already forfeit. Being the horrors' main conductor surely neither history nor judiciary would be kind on him. \n\nUp next his almost son, Mihailov, build up by his almost father and great bureaucrat of the ministries. Lukov's protege for a long time, excessively nurtured and quite likely the second Vodach of Bulgaria, if history had been on his side that is. \n\nNext Alexander Belev, main commissioner for the Jews and minorities, the grand Butcher who terrorized the peoples for years to come, turned neighbor against neighbor, the stench of blood could be almost smelt in the courtroom. \n\nThen Kalchev conducting the countries economic growth. Seemingly innocuous at first, an economist by trade but without his involvement the meat grinder would and could not have functioned the way it did. \n\nFinally Kiril Preslavski, regent, enabler, traitor. Whilst not directly involved in the regime of what Mussolini laid the blueprint for so long ago he allowed them to seize power, he was the one who allowed the fascists to usurp the government with the kings blessing. Without him there maybe never would've been a Bulgaria under the fasce at all. \n\nGuilty all the same. \n\nThe trials would determine their fate, all men defeated in the civil war, utterly crushed by the monarchic forces. The nation, and to an extent the world was awaiting the verdict, no matter who would rise from their ashes one thing was certain, \n\nTheir path ended here."
 twrbulgaria.16.a:0 "The question just was how."
 twrbulgaria.17.t:0 "The Grand Verdict"
 twrbulgaria.17.d:0 "Up the podium five men walked, three would walk down. \n\nUp first was the Vodach Lukov, death by hanging it was. Only he somehow smuggled in a capsule, filled to the brim with cyankali. They found him dead in his cell, foam in his mouth yet appeared oddly serene. The traitor who allowed Lukov to escape justice at last was searched for feverishly, yet none was found. Lukov's final curse onto Bulgarian land it seemed was his inability to accept his fate. \n\nUp next was the son and bureaucrat Mihailov, he was spared the rope but not the key. He would spend the next 20 years under the lock, maybe less of course. Plenty of time to try to polish his image, some joked. A sentence too lenient others groaned. \n\nThen the economist Kalchev, he met the same fate as Mikhailov. Maybe they would exchange letters in prison, they might even pass the time recounting long lost glory. Rumors persisted of them having already signed lucrative deals for first hand accounts of their time in the ministry. \n\nThen the butcher Belev, the rope he met. And face it he would. Only the execution did not go smoothly and he struggled for almost ten minutes before his neck finally snapped. A fitting end, no? The mastermind behind the nightmare escaped the clutches of justice, his bloody arm fortunately didn't. Perhaps for his last moments he didn't want to live up to his reputation. \n\nFinally the regent Preslavski, he opened the fascists the door to power and behind closed ones he would spent the rest of his days. This proved to cause quite the stir, after all what was a man only barely involved in the regime sentenced to more than those directly involved? The reasoning, the judges gave was the possibility of him corrupting the monarchic soul once more, yet that served only to fan the flames, for what were Mikhailov and Kalchev to do once they saw the light of day once more? \n\nWith the demons struck down, the land could breathe again. The only loose end of course the capsule o' cyankali - the newspaper editors were quite pleased, the old world it seemed would not fade away so easily."

But Mihailov was not done yet. \n\nBefore him lay one last adversary, even if he could not be here. His shadow hung over the assembly regardless. It was his job that the shadow would not continue hanging over Bulgaria proper.It was Lukov's ghost he face on the podium and it was Lukov's ghost he would strike down at that spot. He begun. \n\n'The late Vodach Lukov through his years of service has brought much grief and suffering to our nation, while I am not one to slight the dead, in this case I must renounce my convictions for the good of the nation. Lukov has betrayed the spirit of the very nation and crown after betraying its soul and spirit, raped its body, destroyed our people's livelihood, turned neighbor against neighbor and made them endure unspeakable hardship, all in the name of personal glory and pride! His first crime, sullying the nations spirit, by creating a personality cult around the monarchy he eroded the peoples very beliefs, made them lose faith in the bonds that hold this land and people together - all for his personally vainglory, as he wanted to bath in the light of glory that wasn't his - and never will be. The people robbed of the foundations of their very world, could in their hardship, see no other way than to violently raise arms against the snake in our midst! Cut him out of our bosom they attempted and finally they succeeded! With Lukov's body dead it's finally time to destroy his last vestiges! The people's will will finally be made reality!' \n\nAudible gasps in the assembly, some turned over to their neighbor but he ceaselessly finished the assault. \n\n'The late Vodach then, having spilled the blood of our countries men, did not see, hear or relent in the rape of our nation, instead he doubled down, his incompetence blooming as he grew ever more paranoid by the passing day. He refused valuable and brilliant advice by comrade Kalchev, a trend continued with the entire rest of the cabinet, ruling thenceforth as a tyrant not the helmsman he was supposed to be!' \n\nMihailov looked throughout the chamber thoroughly pleased, almost everyone was in some state of shock, anger or even sadness. His final foe to full control over the country had been struck down, propaganda and purging effort in the next couple months would see that their last vestiges would be thoroughly eliminated, the atmosphere of the assembly changed forever he could now finally begun his reforms in earnest."

Backed, nominally in secret but fairly openly, by Germania and Rome, frustrated by Bulgaria's refusal to join the war against the Soviet Union and reluctance to fully cooperate with the Axis, the UBNF gained enough power for German-Italian pressure on Prince Kiril to force him to appoint Lukov as Prime Minister soon after the suspicious death of Tsar Boris in 1943.

Of course, in reality these are little more than show trials.

Though the overt dictatorship of days past is, mercifully, gone, it has been replaced by a regime of lies, masquerading as a democracy and offering up the illusion of choice to the people.\n\nMost are not so easily fooled. Anyone with any kind of awareness knows their votes barely matter, but at this point, the people are simply too tired, too warn out be the constant cycles of violence and instability to care. Those that do care, that do kick up a fuss, well, they're conveniently disqualified from the election and their public gatherings found to somehow be illegal. On the whole, though, the sham elections go off without much of a hitch. The government gains the legitimacy it needs, in return for stability and some limitied voice given back to the people."

Through a series of gathered paramilitary formations that paid homage to Kalchev, they gathered on all sides and surrounded the Parliament. The army was not on Mihailov's side, while no one liked Belev unless he had to. Through a series of conflicts that followed the siege of Parliament, the first grenades flew from the building, remaining in the pockets of all "soldiers" who declared their loyalty to Mihailov and Belev, who planned to overthrow Kalchev and divide it. Kalchev was not allowed to allow that, so he gathered a special detachment of people and organized a counter-offensive. While Mihailov was too busy on one side, Kalchev led a dozen soldiers towards the back entrance, where he clashed with several of his loyalists and managed to break through the building. Reaching the steps, he encountered fierce resistance from his soldiers, but in just five minutes, this fight was over in order to order a counterattack by Kalchev's troops, who stormed the Parliament like enraged Spanish bulls when they sniffed salsa. The conflict was finally over so that the soldiers could take Mihailov and Belev out in chains like ordinary animals that escaped from them. Kalchev finally secured his power, removing from it all his opponents who had made such a bold move that marked their political end and put Kalchev's policy as the only valid one in Bulgaria."

 bulgariaflavour.6.d:0 "Following the events that preceded Lukov's sudden death, a meeting was held on the matter to determine anyone eligible to replace their leader who had led them all this time. There was a gloomy atmosphere in Parliament as people threw in occasional comments, debating who should be the new leader, and once the sentence was over, there would be an awkward 10-second pause until someone else suggested something new. "I honestly think that it might be in our best interest to propose Mihailov for that position." Then they would shut up, creating the already mentioned unpleasant silence. "Yes. Yes. Maybe he is the only choice we have left in this situation." And then everyone fell silent again. After 12 hours of their "conversation", a decision was finally made on what to do. 60% of the vote was in favor of Mihailov, who called for peace and unity after the vote, promising to do everything as Lukov has done so far - while he wanted to form the Bulgarian nation in line with his wishes, destroying every copy. Lukov inherits from the Bulgarian nation."

"I want this man to be neutralized - in any way you can think of and any variant you use." "How do you want us to do that, sir?" "The old, good ways have always been more than successful. I want you to kill him as soon as you see him. Without mercy and without rethinking, because it can cost us the time we need, so to confirm, is this clear to you?" "We fully understand, sir. We will not let you down."\n\nAfter some time, the man who is talking to Mihailov managed to sneak into Kalchev's house, following him since he left the Parliament. Getting out of the car, whistling an old, Bulgarian song, he did not expect the melody to be continued by the shots coming from the gun, releasing blood flowing down the sidewalk and watching the assassin slip into the darkness, disappearing without a trace. Only half an hour passed when a routine inspection "called on the order of a worried neighbor" came to pick up Kalcev's body, but after that, no one could see him anymore."

Hitting him in the back with rifles to force him to move, the guards tried with all their might to carry out what Belev considered a scandalous act of Bulgarian politics, but everyone knew that it was Mihailov's destiny to rule o'er Bulgaria. After they put him in a car during short extraditions during his extradition and tied him up so that he would not make incidents. "Immediately release me!" "Shout at us once more and I will do my best to make the last minutes of your life an example of real hell on earth." Were the words of one of the people who led Belev as far away from Bulgaria as possible for the common good of the people. Belev just looked at him sharply. He expected a reaction like this, but he wasn't ready for it, just for a second. "If you move one more time, I'll smash your head with a steel hammer. Understood?" Belev said nothing more. He finally realized that his end of life in Bulgaria was now over. He had to come up with a plan. He had to know what to do next, but he didn't have time. He realized that now he had to surrender... at least until some new opportunity came."

Accusing the government's past failures to deal with the '52 Crisis and Bulgaria's general stagnation as a sign of weakness, Belev weighed heavily on his usually virulent antisemitic rhetoric on which to pin the issues on. Vowing "Blood for blood" in order to restore Bulgaria's tarnished honour, he ended his speech with a fanatical cry to finally bring all of Bulgaria's "racial enemies" under the heel of the people."

After a brief pounding of metal and the sound of a plate being taken out of a drawer, Belev realized that it was finally time to get his dinner, which he had been looking forward to for ten minutes.\n\n"We apologize for waiting, Mr. Belev, but we had difficulty with the roaster." The baker replied, carrying a hot piece of banitsa in a casserole.\n\n"I hope the wait was worth as much as the banitsa, otherwise you won't have a good time." The baker didn't say a word, but just walked away, moving in the direction of the kitchen. Taking a knife and a fork, Belev cut the first piece of banitsa in half, to see how the heat of the white cheese with which this bakery delight was evaporated. Putting the knife aside, the piece he cut. Trying it, he felt in his mouth how all the flavors he had tried so far were playing while the cheese was playing a waltz with his palate. After swallowing the first piece, he knew that this banitsa was worth the wait, and he attacked it as he attacked his political enemies. He enjoyed swallowing her life for his benefit. After finishing his dinner, tired of eating, he thanked the bakers who almost gave their lives in case he didn't like the banitsa.\n\n"You have all the honors from me and from now on you will be my constant baker, you amazing man." Belev said before leaving the dining room, addressing the chief baker who breathed a sigh of relief."

 bulgariaflavour.12.t:0 "A Case Gone Cold"
 bulgariaflavour.12.d:0 "It had been a week since Hristo Lukov's former deputy Ivan Mihailov was last seen. His distraught wife Natalia had been regularly calling the police station for answers, yet none of them appeared to have any leads. Frustrated with the useless clerks she kept being redirected to, she went down to the Sofia Police Headquarters to talk with the police chief himself. The Police HQ's lobby was quite rowdy as officers seemed to walk in every direction escorting enemies of the state into interrogation rooms for processing. Weaving around the wailing masses of men and women protesting their innocence, she made it to the front desk where a largely uninterested police officer was sorting papers.\n\n"If you've come to report any activities related to Jews and jewry, the Jewish affairs office is down the hall to the right." He said, slightly slurring his words. The man was quite obviously a bit drunk, and Natalia quickly noticed the half-empty bottle of brandy on his desk.\n\n"No, I'm here to ask about a missing persons case. My husband Ivan Mihailov, have you heard anything about him?" The man quickly looked up with a cold stare. "There is no Ivan Mihailov in our records ma'am..." His tone was suddenly very stern, and two police officers who overheard the conversation quickly came to his side.\n\n"I'm sorry Mister... Borisov but I find that hard to believe, he was a government minister under Lukov. Are you certain you haven't misplaced something?" she replied.\n\n"Ma'am there isn't a Mihailov in any of our records nor was there ever any Ivan Mihailov anywhere in Bulgaria." The cop replied, motioning to the two men behind him to arrest Natalia.\n\n"It appears you've been mislead by some advanced kind of Judeo-Bolshevik trickery, perhaps we should discuss this is in a more private area..." Natalia was visibly shocked "You... WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS MY HUSBAND?!" She cried, being dragged into an interrogation room. The door quickly locked behind her, and Natalia's screams quickly became muffled."

The palace was about to shaken up today, as Simeon II's new guard was scheduled to come in today.\n\n"International banks are controlled by..." his tutor said, reading from a new textbook made specifically to educate the new royals on "racial matters". The books had only come in yesterday, and the Tsar was noticeably uncomfortable with the subject matter. "...the Jews?" He said.\n\n"Yes your majesty, the Jews control international finance." The tutor replied. Just as they were to continue studying, a man walked into the royal study.\n\n"Your majesty, the new guards have arrived for your inspection." The officer said. Closing the book, the tutor got up "Well we can continue our lessons another day, don't forget to read some more tonight." He said, leaving the room.\n\nSimeon went outside in the cold to look at his new palace guards. They were undeniably green, fresh recruits likely from the countryside. Their armbands were different this time though, adorn in the symbols of Regent Belev's ultranationalist group. Seeing them as fit, Simeon dismissed them to their new posts. Perhaps a brisk walk would be nice, he thought to himself, walking towards the palace gates.\n\n"Open the door." He said. The guards didn't budge.\n\n"I am your tsar, open the door!" He protested, the guards still didn't twitch. "OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!" He exclaimed, as a guard put his hand on the frustrated boy's shoulder.\n\n"Your majesty, it's too dangerous outside right now, for your safety you'll have to come another time." He explained. Simeon suddenly realized what this meant; his trusted Regent had now effectively placed him on house arrest."

 bulgariaflavour.14.d:0 ""By directive of the Fuhrer Alexander Belev, all homes must be made available for Bulgarian troops at a moment's notice" Ivan Dochev read the letter with rage. This was totally unprecedented even for a martial nation like Bulgaria. Storming out of his office, he made his way into his boss's office. Belev seemed largely distracted, reading a copy of Der Stürmer with his feet up on his desk.\n\n"Ah, hello Dochev, I was just reading a fascinating article here." Belev said, sitting upright "Can you believe that Jewish partisans kill up to three hundred German settlers in the Reichskommissariats every day?" putting the copy of Der Stürmer down, he got two small glasses and poured some brandy into each.\n\n"What is troubling you Dochev? You didn't even bother to knock." Dochev put the crumpled up letter on the desk "Would you mind explaining this? 'Fuhrer', the hell is this supposed to be all about?!" Belev looked at the letter and smiled slightly "Tell me, what do you know about Reinhard Heydrich's Gotenland?" Belev asked putting the letter down.\n\n"Uhh... not much to be honest." Dochev replied. "Now HE knew how to build a state, his word being the word of law. Nobody questioned any of his orders. His word was above all written law. And look at Gotenland now, it's a true model Aryan colony!" Belev seemed to almost bask in his adoration of one of Germany's most notorious politicians. Belev leaned in with a much sterner tone "And if we're going to bring Bulgaria back from its degenerative abyss, we need to bring a bit of Teutonic ideals into Bulgarian society." Dochev, while slightly taken aback, gradually understood. It was after all, just a word. And besides, Belev is probably right."

What were his superiors going to say when they find out he can't meet their impossible quotas? It wasn't his fault that the few trains he did coordinate were more often than not attacked by bandits and other likeminded scum. Drinking from a lukewarm glass of water on his desk, his attention quickly shifted to the man knocking on his door. "Come in." Lyuben said, the door opening to a military officer with a piece of paper in hand "Sir, we found a Jewish family hiding out in the floorboards of a worn-down house five minutes from here. What shall I do with them?" Lyuben looked out in the hall and saw a small family of four Jews in ragged clothing looking at him with a cold, worried stare. Looking back at the military officer, Lyuben ordered him to shoot them outside. Back on his desk, he took out the letter he was writing and threw it in the garbage. Getting a new blank paper out, he began again. His train of thought was quickly interrupted by the sound of gunfire outside his office.

Bringing the ideas of Nazi rule to the once-isolated and stagnant Bulgaria, its immortalized Fuhrer has wasted little time implementing the totalitarian concepts that his likeness used to conquer Europe. While Jews and other "undesirables" had once found relative safety under the corrupt regimes of old, the supreme Fuhrer has finally brought them to his perceived "racial justice". Going on the radio today to announce Bulgaria's final battle, Belev turned his attention to the outside world. Calling Bulgaria's gains during the Second World War "Insufficient", the self-styled Fuhrer bombastically declared his unwavering support for Bulgarian minorities in Greece and Romania and promising their eventual "liberation" from the shackles of brutish foreigners. While the respective governments of Romania and Greece have yet to respond to this blatant provocation, one thing is perfectly clear now. Bulgaria is on the rise again."
