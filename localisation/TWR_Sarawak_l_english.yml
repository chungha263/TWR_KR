  twrsarawak.1.t:0 "The Assasination of the Governor"
  twrsarawak.1.d:0 "In the early hours of the evening, Governor Duncan George Stewart was assasinated! Having gone out for his regular visit among the villages of Sarawak, Governor Duncan George Stewart had stopped at a local school in order to meet and greet the students. After being asked for his photo to be taken, a youth managed to sneak behind him and stab him deeply before the personal guard of the governor apprehended him. Despite his injuries, the Governor decided to continue on with his visit until his suit had been stained red from white. Being transferred to the hospital in Singapore, he passed only a few days later due to his injuries and his assasins were executed by firing squad. \n\nNow with governor Anthony Abell in charge, it is uncertain what his position will be towards the Sarawaks and the Anti-Cession movement..."
  twrsarawak.1.a:0 "We will crush those rebels in the name of the Queen!"
  twrsarawak.1.b:0 "Maybe its time for internal changes."
  twrsarawak.2.t:0 "Our Independence"
  twrsarawak.2.d:0 "With the lackluster administration of the new Governor, the situation in Sarawak turned more urgent with every day. Fueled by the rage of the execution of the two young 'martyrs' who took down the previous Governor, the people of Sarawak grew stronger and stronger, organising themselves through political and paramilitary organisations. And yet, the governor remained oblivious to the situation in his colony until it was too late. \n\nAs the sun dawned across the colony of Sarawak, groups of men and women armed with weaponry and flags marched through the quiet streets up to the Governors palace. A single voice was heard thundering towards the palace, waking up the governor to these words. \n\n'Leave, for these are now Sarawak lands.' \n\nSeeing the sheer numbers of armed militia in front of him, the Governor decided to follow along and after preparing his bags, he was escorted to a car that was guided to drive to Sabah, where he was sent to exile back to the British. \n\nWith the Sarawak flag now flying over the Palace, the streets filled with people celebrating their victory as the new King of Sarawak, White Rajah Anthony Brooke greeted his people. \n\nWith his throne back to him, he made an official announcement, establishing the Kingdom of Sarawak, finally independent from the grasps of foreign crowns. He noted that all Sarawak people should still hold on to their arms, as the British will not let go easily of their already crumbling colonial empire."
  twrsarawak.2.a:0 "Glory to Sarawak!"
  twrsarawak.3.t:0 "Uprising in Sarawak"
  twrsarawak.3.d:0 "Reports have been coming in our colonies in the Indies where the colony of Sarawak has rebelled against us! Kicking out our governor and placing back into power the White Rajahs, they have declared their indepedence away from the British Crown. As our colony, Sarawak provided a chunk of our rubber and oil needs, although far smaller than those of British Malaya. \n\nNow the parliament is at a standstill on wether we should intervene and get Sarawak back under our control or turn our focus on the more important issues currently going on in Europe."
  twrsarawak.3.a:0 "We will take back what is ours!"
  twrsarawak.3.b:0 "We have more important things to do."
  twrsarawak_british.1.t:0 "Victory in Sarawak"
  twrsarawak_british.1.d:0 "With our quick response and the might of our able men, we have restored order back to our colony in Sarawak. As to ensure this doesnt happen again, we have set up even tighter regulations and laws as to minimise any chances of future rebellions."
  twrsarawak_british.1.a:0 "All obey to Her Majesty!"
  twrsarawak_british.2.t:0 "Defeat in Sarawak"
  twrsarawak_british.2.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of our men, they failed to defeat the rebellion in Sarawak and many of the drafted men have dropped their arms, preferring to return home than die for a small colony."
  twrsarawak_british.2.a:0 "A small blow that stings"
  twrsarawak_sarawak.1.t:0 "We are victorious!"
  twrsarawak_sarawak.1.d:0 "Our brave men and women managed to push back the British from even stepping on a single meter of Sarawak land! With our true King in power now, the British will most likely not attempt any more attacks towards us, with many of their men deserting the battlefield."
  twrsarawak_sarawak.1.a:0 "Victory for Sarawak!"
  twrsarawak_sarawak.2.t:0 "In chains again..."
  twrsarawak_sarawak.2.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of our men and women, we lost our battle against the British. With the White Rajah escaping to Dutch Indonesia in exile, the British governor has returned into power and even stricter laws have enslaved our people."
  twrsarawak_sarawak.2.a:0 "Sarawak will live in our hearts."
  twrsarawak.4.t:0 "White Rajah Exiled to Indonesia"
  twrsarawak.4.d:0 "With the recent defeat of the Sarawak rebellion, their leader, the White Rajah Anthony Brooke has fled to Indonesia in exile as to avoid capture from the British."
  twrsarawak.4.a:0 "Another monarch in exile."
