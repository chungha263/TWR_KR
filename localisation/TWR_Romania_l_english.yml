 #LEADERS
 Mihai_Antonescu_DESC:0 "Not related to Marshal Ion Antonescu, Mihai Antonescu was the Marshal's right hand man. When Ion Antonescu was busy handling military affairs during Romania's participation in the Anti-Soviet War, Mihai Antonescu handled the majority of internal affairs. Serving as the Deputy Prime Minister, Mihai Antonescu ruled with an iron fist, carrying out the dictator's wills in Romania and appeasing the radicals by implementing radical Anti-Jewish laws.\n\nNaturally, Mihai Antonescu became the successor shortly after Ion Antonescu's death. Although, he is now determined to maintain the regime's relevance by 'playing both sides', drastically changing his views to present himself as an enlightened centrist between moderatism and radicalism."
 iron_guard_general:0 "Iron Guard"
 iron_guard_general_desc:0 "This general is a member of the Iron Guard."
 King_Mihai_DESC:0 "Mihai I, born October 25, 1921 in Sinaia, son of Carol II. Shortly after his birth, his father got into a controversial relationship with his mistress, which infuriated the Romanian political scene, and Carol had to leave the country until Mihai was declared the heir of the crown. After his grandfather Ferdinand died in July 1927, Mihai usurped the throne, but soon after, a regency was formed that would hold power until Mihai turned 18.\n\nShortly after the founding of the regency, at the invitation of politicians dissatisfied with the actions of the regency, Carol II returned to Romania to act on behalf of his son. Soon after, Mihai was proclaimed Crown Prince and later entered the Romanian Senate. Shortly after the Second Vienna Award, Marshal Antonescu took power launched a coup in September, and later on September 26 placed Mihai as an "ornament King" while Antonescu himself held absolute power.\n\nAfter the end of the European War, Mihai continued to sit in the shadow of the politicians who maintained contacts with Germany, thus shaming the status of Romania. Mihai grew to resent this situation after a whole decade of suspicion towards the regime. Now the time has finally come, with Mihai taking the matters of the state into his own hands."
 HORIA_SIMA_DESC:0 "Horia Sima is to many the face of the far-right Legionarist movement in Romania, having joined the organization at a young age in 1927. He quickly rose through the party's ranks proving himself to be a skillful organizer in the wake of extensive crackdowns by the Romanian government that saw much of its leadership (Including Sima's mentor, Corneliu Codreanu) imprisoned and executed in 1938. Having barely secured a position for himself in Romania following the nation's drift into the German sphere, the newly invigorated Iron Guard would go on to carry out barbaric pogroms in the Transnistrian Governate amidst growing anxiety from Ion Antonescu's government. Fleeing to Germany after a botched coup in 1941, the new Conducător spent over a decade quietly plotting for his eventual return to Romania. Now at the helm of a shattered nation, Sima's reign of terror can finally reach the apex needed to shape Romania in his own twisted image."
 Legion_Senate_DESC:0 "On average, the leadership of Romania rotates multiple times in a a single month. The constant power struggle between the radical student unions, old Legionnaires, peasants leaders, and the fragments of the original Iron Guard have resulted in absolute chaos within the Romanian government. While the government has effectively ceased to function, at least on surface members still pledge their absolute loyalty to the Codreanu idea."
 Gheorghe_Alexianu_DESC:0 "A lawyer, high school teacher and associate professor. Most importantly, the former governor of Transnistria.\n\nGheorghe Alexianu conducted his law studies at University of Bucharest. After graduation he was for a year professor of philosophy and history at a high school in Râmnicu Vâlcea, then he attended doctoral courses at University of Bucharest and obtained the title of doctor in legal sciences. From 1927 he held the position of associate professor of public law at the Chernivtsi University, where he worked until 1938.\n\nHis bureaucratic career began on August 29, 1938, when he was appointed governor of Tinutul Suceava. But most importantly, after Romania acquired Transnistria, Ion Antonescu appointed Alexianu as the Governor of Transnistria, the position that made him into an infamous politician. With brutal efficiency, Alexianu did the bidding of the regime in Transnistria, organizing ghettos and concentration camps to place the deported Romanian and Ukrainian Jews and Gypsies. Tens of thousands died under Alexianu's supervision.\n\nIt was with this record of bloodshed that landed him the job of Deputy Prime Minister upon Ion Antonescu's death and Mihai Antonescu's rise to prominence. Now as the nation's leader, there is no doubt that Alexianu might relive his bloody days as governor."
 Corneliu_Georgescu_DESC:0 "Born on January 2, 1902, Corneliu Georgescu was a lawyer before becoming one of the founding members of the Legionary Movement. He served as Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of National Economy for the Colonization of the Evacuated Population in the Ion Antonescu government.\n\nCorneliu Georgescu is generally more aligned with the traditional Iron Guard views, and was a skeptic of Iron Guard's second generation leadership, which included a distaste for Horia Sima's control. Georgescu views himself as a more pure leader of the Iron Guard, as he had much closer connections with Corneliu Zelea Codreanu."
 Ion_Mihalache_DESC:0 "Leader of the National Peasants' Party, Ion Mihalache was a schoolteacher and a lieutenant in the Romanian Army during the Great War. He soon became popular among the locals, and served as the president of the local teachers' association. He founded the Peasants' Party in 1918, and became Vaida-Voevod's Minister of Agriculture on December 16, 1919. During the interwar years, Mihalache steadily climbed the political ladder, rising in political prominence.\n\nMihalache also became a staunch opponent of the Iron Guard, to the point where he congratulated Ion Antonescu for defeating the Iron Guard in the Legionary Rebellion. But since then, Mihalache stood against the dictatorship on most matters except for Romanian irredentism."
 GHEORGHE_TATARESCU_DESC:0 "Gheorghe Tătărescu was the 36th Prime Minister of Romania, and through years, he is once again serving as Prime Minister.\n\nNow as the leader of the PNL, Gheorghe Tătărescu was expelled from the party during the Ion Antonescu administration, when he was accused of being too close with the leftists. But before this period of instability, initially Tătărescu served under multiple cabinets before becoming Prime Minister himself, and he also supported King Carol's National Renaissance Front and advocated for authortarian rule with free trade. In the political scene, Tătărescu is regarded by most as a controversial figure, with his political ideology being extremely complicated.\n\nBut for now, as the leader of the nation once again, Tătărescu once again has the opportunity to build an everlasting legacy."
 #EVENTS#
 twrromflav.1.t:0 "Day of the Unification of the Principalities"
 twrromflav.1.d:0 "Celebrated every 24 January, this holiday commemorate the unification of the Romanian Principalities under prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza.\n\nViewed as one of the first steps towards a unified Romanian state, this holiday is of high importance to Romanian national pride."
 twrromflav.1.a:0 "Nihil Sine Deo!"
 twrromania.0.t:0 "The Kingdom's Situation"
 twrromania.0.d:0 "While the Kingdom of Romania enjoyed the status of being one of the victors, this victory was bitter sweet.\n\nThe territories of Transylvania are still under Hungarian occupation, and the dream of a truly Greater Romania has yet to be realised. Despite Romania's hatred towards our Hungarian oppressors, heavy German influence and the dictatorship's compliance has prevented any major conflicts between the two. Internally, the nation was held together by Marshal Ion Antonescu, and Romania remained stable under his iron fist.\n\nHowever, Marshal Ion Antonescu's passing in 1951 proved to be the last straw.\n\nWith a rapidly worsening political scene, Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Antonescu became Romania's new dictator. His new government immediately set out to both appease and combat Germany's influence in the country, by granting exiled Iron Guard politicians amnesty and releasing imprisoned figures of the moderate wing. These political maneuvers were justified with the goal of allowing both opposing factions to combat each other, which would weaken them both and give the ruling government leverage over the two. Although, these new tactics were only recently implemented, and their results might improve the nation's stability or have the complete opposite effects. But, only time will tell."
 twrromania.0.a:0 "Turbulent times for Romania..."
 twrromania.1.t:0 "Pitesti Mausoleum"
 twrromania.1.d:0 "In Ion Antonescu's birthplace of Pitesti, a mausoleum has been constructed in the former dictator's honour. In the completion ceremony, many ministers, politicians and generals gathered to pay their respect. Most importantly, Prime Minister Mihai Antonescu, Leader of the Iron Guard, Horia Sima, and King Michael all appeared in the same venue.\n\nDespite the Iron Guard's shakey history with Marshal Ion Antonescu, Horia Sima led his most loyal Legionnaires to pay their respect. The King was also obligated to appear at this ceremony, since it was his duty to act as the national figurehead.\n\nThe three did not speak to each other throughout the event, and the completion ceremony finished without commotion. Soon after, the mausoleum was opened for the public, and the three returned to their daily routines."
 twrromania.1.a:0 "A moment of silence."
 twrromania.2.t:0 "Legionary Senate Reopened"
 twrromania.2.d:0 "In Isai, the long disbanded Legionary Senate has been reformed by Horia Sima.\n\nFunctioning as an advisory body to the Legion, the Legionary Senate is an unelected body of so-called "Senators" appointed by the leader himself. Becoming a Legionary Senator is what most Legionnaires aspire to achieve, this senate will serve as the administrative center of the Iron Guard, entrenching the Legionnaires' status in the region."
 twrromania.2.a:0 "Watch them carefully."
 twrromania.3.t:0 "Odessa: The Model City"
 twrromania.3.d:0 "Under the reign of a fairly moderate mayor that had a troubled relationship with Ion Antonescu, Odessa has been transformed into a model city of Transnistria.\n\nGherman Pantea reformed many services in the city since Odessa's liberation. With one of his most notable act being the expansion of Odessa University and the expansion of free trade economic zone. This model city has expanded its influence to the surrounding region, popularizing the mayor's moderate ideals."
 twrromania.3.a:0 "The jewel of Transnistria."
 twrromania.4.t:0 "University of Bucharest - Monarchist Rally"
 twrromania.4.d:0 "Responding to the recent opening of the Pitesti Mausoleum, a monarchist student organization at the University of Bucharest have organized a rally, hoping to celebrate the monarchy's great achievements.\n\nThis rally was approved and endorsed by the local government, since this act of simple patriotism is viewed as beneficial for the ruling regime. Initially, the rally went as intended, until the students' chants slowly shifted focus towards the denouement of barbarism, an indirect attack towards the Iron Guard.\n\nThe Bucharest Police reports that the situation is well within control, and the crowd is already dispersing."
 twrromania.4.a:0 "Nothing out of the norm."
 twrromania.5.t:0 "Clashes in Bucharest"
 twrromania.5.d:0 "As the rally ended and the people returned home, a group of Legionnaires formed by opposing students have entered the area, identifying the individuals that have attended the rally then proceeded to brutalize them.\n\nThis situation deteriorated as fights have broke out across the capital. The police was stretched thin and was pinned to defend key government locations instead of responding to the acts of violence. Shots were fired by the Legionnaires, as the local, armed "Death Squads" received permission from Isai to engage."
 twrromania.5.a:0 "We will respond...eventually."
 twrromania.5.b:0 "Send in the military police immediately!"
 twrromania.6.t:0 "Bucharest Suppressed"
 twrromania.6.d:0 "The fight between the Legionnaires and the monarchist activists have been suppressed by a military unit from outside Bucharest. 4 armed Legionnaires, all under the age of 21 have been killed during the restoration of order, and the damage to property is surprisingly minimal."
 twrromania.6.a:0 "Rowdy teenagers..."
 twrromania.7.t:0 "Iron Guard Demands Justice"
 twrromania.7.d:0 "From Isai, Horia Sima has called an emergency session of the Legionary Senate. In his opening speech, Horia Sima referred to the recent events at Bucharest as "acts of Jewish-Freemasonry aggression against Romania", he then introduced a bill that would grant the 4 young dead Legionnaires "Honourary Senator", which passed unanimously.\n\nKnowing that the government might react, Horia Sima ended the session with a vague statement, calling that the fight for Greater Romania is not yet over, and many enemies within are still plotting the Iron Guards' demise."
 twrromania.7.a:0 "Oh dear..."
 twrromania.8.t:0 "Monarchist Demands Justice"
 twrromania.8.d:0 "Due to our government's slow response, many are injured by the fights at Bucharest. During the period of brief chaos, a university student named Rares Neacsu was shot and lynched by a Legionary mob.\n\nDespite orders that have banned public gatherings, many were outraged by this news, with many taking to the street and calling for justice.\n\nMeanwhile, Horia Sima at the Legionary Senate has condemned these demonstrations, calling them degenerative and a great threat to national security. In a declaration made by the Iron Guard leadership, they called for swift actions by the government against these demonstrations."
 twrromania.8.a:0 "Oh dear..."
 twrromania.9.t:0 "Report: Monarchist Movement"
 twrromania.9.d:0 "The Monarchist Movement, referred by many as the "Moderates" is not officially sanctioned and endorsed by the King. However, as the nation's figurehead, the moderates have chosen King Michael as the spiritual leader of the movement.\n\nMany members of the military and the local governments are associated with the movement, especially the influential region of Odessa and the Governate of Bessarabia, staunchly against the radical Iron Guard."
 twrromania.9.a:0 "Valuable information."
 twrromania.10.t:0 "Report: Legionary Movement"
 twrromania.10.d:0 "The Legion of the Archangel Michael, commonly known as the Iron Guard is headed by Horia Sima, a former exile under the reign of Ion Antonescu but recently invited back to Romania by our regime is a strong organization.\n\nThe Iron Guard is mainly consisted of intellectuals and university students, advocating for a strong, Orthodox, traditionalist Romania. These Legionnaires have established a stronghold in Moldova, looking for aggressive outward expansion towards all parts of Romania."
 twrromania.10.a:0 "Valuable information."
 twrromania.11.t:0 "Romanian Power Struggle"
 twrromania.11.d:0 "For better or for worse, the power struggle in Romania has truly began. Mihai Antonescu's plans of pitting the factions against one another must be enacted swiftly for the regime's political stability. We must ally with one of the faction to discredit the opposition, then discard them once our reign is secured."
 twrromania.11.a:0 "Let's meet the king."
 twrromania.11.b:0 "Strike a deal with the Iron Guard."

 twrromania_cw.4.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 twrromania_cw.5.t:0 "Romanian Civil War"
 twrromania_cw.5.d:0 "In an extremely unstable period, the Romanian Civil War has been brewing since the death of Ion Antonescu. While the government attempted to maintain control, recently, a series of events have marked the breaking point for all semblance of stability.\n\nBetween the "Moderates" led by King Michael and the Legionnaires led by Horia Sima, supporters of both sides have taken up arms, with the overwhelming majority of the Romanian general staff siding with the King.\n\nNobody is certain on which side would emerge as the victor, but all can agree that this civil war marks a bloody turn for Romanian history."
 twrromania_cw.5.a:0 "There can only be one!"
 twrromania_cw.5.b:0 "Another nation implodes..."
 twrromania_cw.6.t:0 "Legionnaire Victory in Romania"
 twrromania_cw.6.d:0 "Through a great deal of conflict and bloodshed, the Legionnaires have managed to secure their leadership position in the whole of Romania.\n\nDenouncing the policies of previous governments, the Iron Guard seeks to bring about an age of greatness and traditional values back to the degenerating society of Romania. With Horia Sima at the helm, Romania is expected to take a drastic shift towards radical tendencies."
 twrromania_cw.6.a:0 "For the Holy Cross, for the country!"
 twrromania_cw.6.b:0 "Darkness in Romania."
 twrromania_cw.7.t:0 "Monarchist Victory in Romania"
 twrromania_cw.7.d:0 "Through a great deal of political infighting and hard Decisions, the Monarchists have managed to take full control of Romania.\n\nDenouncing the radical policies and the Iron Guard, the Monarchist movement seeks to label itself as the moderate movement for Romania, demonstrating itself as a rational alternative compared to the other options. While King Michael is still retaining a great deal of power, most within the nation expect him to transfer power to a somewhat democratic leadership as soon as possible."

 twrromania_cw.8.t:0 "Mihai Antonescu Assassinated!"
 twrromania_cw.8.d:0 "On his journey to a cabinet meeting, Mihai Antonescu's vehicle was attacked by 3 gunmen armed with machine guns. Mihai Antonescu and his chauffeur died on the spot to dozens of gun wounds, despite the fact that the vehicle was escorted by a squad of bodyguards.\n\nThe assailants initially fled the scene and escaped into the Bucharest countryside. But after the police's efforts, the gunmen were tracked down and arrested. Shortly after the news of his death reached the rest of the country, Deputy Prime Minister Gheorghe Alexianu has assumed all duties of the Prime Minister."
 twrromania_cw.8.a:0 "Stability dies with Antonescu..."
 twrromania_cw.9.t:0 "Romanian Prime Minister Assassinated"
 twrromania_cw.9.d:0 "Presumably disgruntled by Romania's lackluster results in the recent Romanian-Hungarian War, gunmen armed with machine guns have assassinated the Prime Minister of Romania - Mihai Antonescu.\n\nAntonescu was killed during his car ride to a government meeting, and almost immediately died from the gun wounds. Reportedly, the police only managed to arrest the assailants after a 2 hour manhunt deep into the Bucharest countryside.\n\nShortly after the death of the Antonescu was confirmed, Deputy Prime Minister Gheorghe Alexianu has assumed the office of Prime Minister."

 twrromania_cw.10.t:0 "King Michael's Coup"
 twrromania_cw.10.d:0 "Seeing the new government as weak and incapable, King Michael and his loyalist supporters have successfully forced out the brief Alexianu government.\n\nAlexianu's government was barely a week old when it lost the support of the military, causing many to pledge their loyalty to the impending coup, which allowed for a smooth transfer of power from the Prime Minister directly to the King. But as the proclamation was announced by the King and the military, Legionnaires under the command of Horia Sima refused to pledge loyalty to the new government, choosing to declare an open rebellion against the sitting government."
 twrromania_cw.10.a:0 "Long live the King!"
 twrromania_cw.10.b:0 "For the Holy Cross!"
 twrromania_cw.11.t:0 "Iron Guard Takeover"
 twrromania_cw.11.d:0 "Seeing the new government as weak and indecisive, the Iron Guard, the establishment's supposed ally has betrayed the recently Alexianu government, successfully overthrowing Alexianu.\n\nAlexianu's government was destroyed within, as the Iron Guard has managed to establish a network within the cabinet, ensuring the collapse of the government if they were to suffer from a major defeat. This allowed Horia Sima to assume leadership position with the aid of his Iron Guard, becoming the new de facto ruler of Romania.\n\nHowever, when the Iron Guard attempted to proclaim their new role as the sitting government, Legionnaires failed to arrest the King by storming the Royal Palace, causing the King to flee alongside the traditionalist general corp, declaring that the Iron Guard government as illegal and launching an open rebellion." 

 twrromania_war.0.t:0 "Hitler is Dying"
 twrromania_war.0.d:0 "Reliable sources within the Reich have informed us of Adolf Hitler's rapidly declining health.

 ROM_Fp_Against_Italy_desc:0 "Our final and greatest enemy in our long struggle for dominance of the Balkans is Italy, who has long reached for the same hegemony that is currently our aim. This climactic conflict has been, perhaps, inevitable. Only one can become master of the Balkans, and rule from Zagreb to Varna. Rest assured, it will not be Rome, but Romania."
 ROM_Fp_The_Dead_Reich:0 "Ashes of the Reich"
 ROM_Fp_The_Dead_Reich_desc:0 "With the collapse of the Reich, a multitude of states have emerged from the chaos, providing us with a great opportunity even as it gives us reason for caution. Should we play our cards right, we will be able to influence the German people to our advantage, which would be greatly helpful to our cause."
 
 ROM_EM_Romanian_Rail_System:0 "Romanian Rail System"
 ROM_EM_Romanian_Rail_System_desc:0 "Railways are the transportation lifeblood of any modern, industrialised nation, allowing fast and efficient transportation of goods and people across long distances. However, our railways system is deeply inadequate for the needs of the modern era. As we attempt to strengthen and modernise our industry, one of our first steps must be the improvement of our railway network."
 ROM_EM_Maintaining_Petrol_Supremacy:0 "Maintaining Petrol Supremacy"
 ROM_EM_Maintaining_Petrol_Supremacy_desc:0 "Romania is blessed with its oilfields, and petroleum has been for some time now our most important industry. As global oil demand ever increases, we must continue to focus on our most strategic resource and continue to improve the infrastructure of its extraction."
 ROM_EM_Expanding_Ploiesti_Complex:0 "Expanding the Ploiesti Oil Complex"
 ROM_EM_Expanding_Ploiesti_Complex_desc:0 "The Ploiesti oil complex is the centrepiece of our petroleum industry already, and produces large quantities of oil for the European market. We should make the necessary investments to expand this complex, extracting more oil and improving secondary refining industries in the region."
 ROM_EM_Exports_For_Economic_Growth:0 "Exports for Growth"
 ROM_EM_Exports_For_Economic_Growth_desc:0 "With the continued expansion of our oil industry, exports of not only crude oil but petroleum-based products such as fuel and plastics are creating a small export boom. We should encourage continued and competitive exports to boost our economic growth."
 ROM_EM_Reinvesting_Oil_Money:0 "Reinvesting Oil Profits"
 ROM_EM_Reinvesting_Oil_Money_desc:0 "In the modern age, oil is an incredibly lucrative industry, providing large sums of money for a relatively small nation like Romania. While we have the ability to do so, we should reinvest profits from our oil production to improve other infrastructure and services across the country."
 ROM_EM_Forging_Alternative:0 "Forging Alternatives"
 ROM_EM_Forging_Alternative_desc:0 "Oil has always been one of our key industries, and will continue to be, but history shows the folly of economic overreliance on one market or resource, especially one as volatile as oil. With the resources we now have, we should concentrate on diversifying our economy, and building up other modern industries alongside petroleum."
 ROM_EM_Galati_Industrial_Zone:0 "Galati Industrial Zone"
 ROM_EM_Galati_Industrial_Zone_desc:0 "As we seek to expand our general industries, the Galati region offers a great site. Situated in the underexploited Moldavia region in the east of the country, the port of Galati on the Danube also offers excellent transportation links. We will direct our businesses and industries to set up in this location and boost our output."
 ROM_EM_Rapid_Industrialization:0 "Rapid Industrialization"
 ROM_EM_Rapid_Industrialization_desc:0 "Industrialisation is more than just a single large industry. We must push to comprehensively industrialise our entire society and economy to catch up with the most economically developed countries and improve the economic prospects and living standards of our population."
 ROM_EM_Introduce_Mechanical_Farming:0 "Introduce Mechanical Farming"
 ROM_EM_Introduce_Mechanical_Farming_desc:0 "Unfortunately, most of our large agricultural sector remains technologically basic, creating the need for a large workforce and holding down productivity. We must invest in agricultural industrialisation, supplying tractors and machines to the farmers, allowing greater output of food and agricultural goods and accelerated urbanisation."
 ROM_EM_A_Thriving_Arms_Industry:0 "A Thriving Arms Industry"
 ROM_EM_A_Thriving_Arms_Industry_desc:0 "As our economy further industrialises, one of the greatest benefits is allowing us to develop and expand our arms industry. The industrial base we have created will allow us to expand the production of weapons and supplies needed for our armed forces, strengthen our defensive and offensive capabilities in the long-run."
 ROM_EM_Coastal_Priority_Scheme:0 "Coastal Development Scheme"
 ROM_EM_Coastal_Priority_Scheme_desc:0 "Unfortunately, so far our coasts have been disappointingly underutilised. The seas are the lifeblood of world trade, and we must expand our coastal port facilities, cities and infrastructure in order to better integrate ourselves into the maritime trading community."
 ROM_EM_Construction_Boom:0 "Construction Boom of [GetYear]"
 ROM_EM_Construction_Boom_desc:0 "As our economy and industry expands, we are seeing an unprecedented expansion of construction across the country, with major infrastructure projects underway. This must be encouraged and further accelerated to speed up the pace of our economic development."
 ROM_EM_Training_the_Professionals:0 "Expand the Politehnica University of Bucharest"
 ROM_EM_Training_the_Professionals_desc:0 "As we expand and develop our economy, we will need large numbers of highly educated technical experts to lead the way towards economic and scientific development. Expanding our largest technical university, the Politehnica University of Bucharest, will allow us to educate more students and increase our highly educated population over time."

 ROM_MIL_Romanian_Armed_Forces:0 "Romanian Armed Forces"
 ROM_MIL_Romanian_Armed_Forces_desc:0 "If we intend to exert significant influence over our neighbors we must build up our military to guarantee our hard power. The first step to accomplish this is to assemble a military commission to review every aspect of our armed forces and assembles plans to improve our military capability. With these commission plans, we will be able to weigh the options and choose our path to military success."
 ROM_MIL_Romanian_Land_Forces:0 "Romanian Land Forces"
 ROM_MIL_Romanian_Land_Forces_desc:0 "The most important part of our armed forces is the Romanian Land Forces, which constitute the most people and equipment of the Armed Forces. If we intend to effectively win a war we will have to look to our past, and discover the future of Land Warfare. Our commission will begin to thoroughly look over combat reports, war diaries, and logistical records to see what can be done.The most important part of our armed forces is the Romanian Land Forces, which constitute the most people and equipment of the Armed Forces.

 ROM_MIL_Legacy_of_Barbarossa_desc:0 "An important action for us to undertake is to review how the Land Forces performed in the past, in the context of invading the Soviet Union. While the most serious victories were achieved by the Germans, we must also look into how well our forces faired, and why. We must do what we can to maximize our victories from Barbarossa and minimize our weaknesses."
 ROM_MIL_Experiment_with_Tank_Groups:0 "Experimental Tank Groups"
 ROM_MIL_Experiment_with_Tank_Groups_desc:0 "In order to bring about the ultimate vengeance to our enemies, we must bring our army into the second half of the 20th century. While we have utilized tanks for a couple of decades, we have never had the same level of success as the Germans have with their tanks. We must learn from the Germans and begin to concentrate our tanks amongst armored divisions and battalions and use them as the spearhead for our military success."
 ROM_MIL_Domestic_Panzer_Production:0 "Domestic Panzer Production"
 ROM_MIL_Domestic_Panzer_Production_desc:0 "For too long our armored units have relied on foreign, mostly German, tanks to supply our frontline units. We must reduce this dependency, this addiction, on German tanks, lest we lose access to these tanks if we take a fresh, anti-German foreign policy."
 ROM_MIL_Rosiori_Spirit:0 "Rosiori Spirit"
 ROM_MIL_Rosiori_Spirit_desc:0 "During both of the great wars of the 20th century, the Rosiori were the pride of Romania in combat, their bright uniforms were great for propaganda and making the enemy tremble upon seeing the Romanian Reds. If we were to imitate this is propaganda and militarization campaigns we would be able to capture our people in support of the pride of the Romanian Land Forces."
 ROM_MIL_The_11th_Group:0 "11th Battle Group"
 ROM_MIL_The_11th_Group_desc:0 "If we intend to take full advantage of our recent expanses into armored and mobile warfare, we must form a joint Battle Group to utilize our new tanks, motorized infantry, and elite cavalry units in a fast-moving, frontal assault unit. This will allow us to strike deep into our enemy’s defenses and fully utilize all of the new military innovations."
 ROM_MIL_Traditional_Expansion:0 "Traditional Expansion"
 ROM_MIL_Traditional_Expansion_desc:0 "If we want a truly great military, we must go with what has been tried and tested. By increasing military spending and encouraging service time extensions, we will be able to put the focus on infantry and other apparatus of traditional warfare. Not only will we focus on infantry, but go with the more traditional forms of warfare within our geographical confines."
 ROM_MIL_Experts_of_Mountain_Warfare:0 "Experts of Mountain War"
 ROM_MIL_Experts_of_Mountain_Warfare_desc:0 "Romania is an extremely mountainous country, while this is usually cumbersome, with the right investments we will be able to turn this to our advantage. Entire battalions, if not divisions, should be trained to perfection in mountain warfare, rather than a logistical setback, our mountains will be a bastion of our national defense."
 ROM_MIL_Artillery_Domination:0 "Artillery Domination"
 ROM_MIL_Artillery_Domination_desc:0 "If we intend to wage a long-term war, we must be able to outgun our enemy at every opportunity. A key component of this will be our artillery capability as compared to our neighbors. We must do whatever we can to ensure that our artillery is able to out-range, out-shell, and out-gun our enemies."
 ROM_MIL_Strengthen_the_Bucharest_Garrison:0 "Strengthen the Bucharest Garrison"
 ROM_MIL_Strengthen_the_Bucharest_Garrison_desc:0 "Since 1939, the Bucharest Garrison has been used to deter enemy invasion from the steps of the capitol. If we wanted to display Romania’s military might, there would be no better place to do it other than the capital. Seeing some of the world’s finest soldiers in their cities will inspire the Romanian people and keep them on board for any kind of war we drag them into."
 ROM_MIL_Motorize_the_Formations:0 "Motorize the Army"
 ROM_MIL_Motorize_the_Formations_desc:0 "No matter how we decided to expand the army, we must spend time and effort into ensuring our infantry and other forces have the highest level of mobility and logistical efficiency we can afford them. We will begin to pour funding to updating our outdated trucks and we should prioritize spending our industrial capacity on getting the soldiers those trucks."
 ROM_MIL_Romanian_Strategic_Office:0 "Romanian Strategic Office"
 ROM_MIL_Romanian_Strategic_Office_desc:0 "For the highest level of strategic coordination within our military, we need an overarching authority to direct the various types of land forces to make sure they work in tandem with each other. This will ensure that we play the various types of units to their strengths and weaknesses respectively."
 ROM_MIL_Romanian_Navy:0 "Romanian Navy"
 ROM_MIL_Romanian_Navy_desc:0 "Our navy has never been the main focus of our budget or national defense strategy, but that does not mean we cannot invest in our navy. For a truly strong Romania, we must have a navy to transport and protect our soldiers from coast to coast and compete with any navy that seeks to impede that."
 ROM_MIL_Study_German_Doctrine:0 "Study German Naval Doctrine"
 ROM_MIL_Study_German_Doctrine_desc:0 "The Germans were clearly some of the greatest winners from the series of wars in the 20th century, and they have always pushed the line for what was considered acceptable in naval warfare. We have a lot to learn from our former allies especially when it comes to unrestricted and dominate submarine warfare."
 ROM_MIL_Control_the_Black_Sea:0 "Control the Black Sea"
 ROM_MIL_Control_the_Black_Sea_desc:0 "The primary objective for our navy should be the complete and total domination of our only ocean access, we must be able to effectively protest our trade as it comes to our ports and travels along the sea. By achieving Black Sea dominance we will be able to prevent the enemy from effectively transporting soldiers, resources, and equipment through our shared waters."
 ROM_MIL_From_the_Depths:0 "From the Depths"
 ROM_MIL_From_the_Depths_desc:0 "The most obvious way to accomplish Black Sea Dominance is to utilize a fleet of submarines. This will greatly improve our convoy raiding abilities, not to mention the massive amount of demoralization that comes from knowing any one of your ships could sink at any moment. Our enemies will learn to fear our submarines and our friends will learn just what we are capable of!"
 ROM_MIL_Lock_the_Black_Sea:0 "Lock the Sea"
 ROM_MIL_Lock_the_Black_Sea_desc:0 "We do not have to be entirely offensive in our naval doctrine, with our new fleet of submarines we will be able to properly escort and protect a fleet of minelaying ships that will block a significant portion of our enemies from even getting close to our coast."
 ROM_MIL_Kickstart_Domestic_Dockyards:0 "Kickstart Domestic Dockyards"
 ROM_MIL_Kickstart_Domestic_Dockyards_desc:0 "If we intend to become a navy power, we cannot let our navy be supplied by foreign ship companies.

 ROM_MIL_Protect_Our_Coast:0 "Protecting Our Coast"
 ROM_MIL_Protect_Our_Coast_desc:0 "In order to ensure the highest level of control over our coasts, we must utilize our new dockyards to produce coastal protection fleets. Smaller surface ships will prevent our enemies from reaching our coasts and bombarding our land forces."
 ROM_MIL_On_the_Surface:0 "The Surface Fleet"
 ROM_MIL_On_the_Surface_desc:0 "The most important part of any successful navy is a specialized strike force of surface ships able to engage enemy surface and escort fleets to ensure we have a way to directly engage the enemy. This will also give us a limited way to engage the enemy merchant marine along with more conventional forms of naval warfare such as cruisers or destroyers."
 ROM_MIL_Construct_Naval_Fortifications:0 "Construct Naval Fortifications"
 ROM_MIL_Construct_Naval_Fortifications_desc:0 "The final step in our coastal defense program should be the utilization of our military construction efforts to bring about a wall of fortifications along the coast to prevent enemy amphibious landings. Due to the proximity of our potential enemies on the black sea, we must not allow our enemy to breach these defenses or we may end up fighting a two front war.The final step in our coastal defense program should be the utilization of our military construction efforts to bring about a wall of fortifications along the coast to prevent enemy amphibious landings.

 ROM_MIL_Romanian_Air_Force:0 "Romanian Air Force"
 ROM_MIL_Romanian_Air_Force_desc:0 "Unlike our navy, the Air Force of Romania is one of the few apparatus’s of the state we can be proud of in comparison to our Balkan neighbors. While we are still ahead of our neighbors, it would be foolish not to make a effort to improve our Air Force and achieve even further domination of the skies."
 ROM_MIL_Expand_the_Air_Wings:0 "Expand the Air Wings"
 ROM_MIL_Expand_the_Air_Wings_desc:0 "To be able to more effectively field our airforce, we must have cohesive and complete air wings to allow for the quick and easy fulfillment of a wings set goal. For us this means maximizing production of our pre-existing models to bring our wings to proper size with a consistent model of plane."
 ROM_MIL_Promote_Aces:0 "Promoting Aces"
 ROM_MIL_Promote_Aces_desc:0 "Lead by example is a great military principle, and this obviously still applies for the Air Force.

 ROM_MIL_Construct_Military_Airfields_desc:0 "Any good Air Force must have a large deployment range. To this principle we will begin a massive project of Airfield construction and expansion, this will allow for our planes to fly well beyond our borders and frontlines, and rather than be restricted to urban Air Fields, our planes will fly from the nearest possible location to their destination."
 ROM_MIL_Opening_of_the_Air_Force_Academy:0 "Opening the Air Force Academy"
 ROM_MIL_Opening_of_the_Air_Force_Academy_desc:0 "Not only must we have heroic aces and successful auxiliary staff, we must also have officers to lead these men.

Soon the academy will be opened with dozens of promising cadets filling our first graduating company.Not only must we have heroic aces and successful auxiliary staff, we must also have officers to lead these men.

 ROM_MIL_Independent_Special_Trooper_Division_desc:0 "Now that we have achieved the full range, leadership, and capacity of any competent Air Force, we will be able to explore the promises of a parachute force. Rather than scattered about multiple flights and divisions we will form a single division devoted to the highest quality of parachute combat. Soon the best of the best from various units with parachute capabilities will fill the divisions ranks and be ready for combat shortly."
