Just before the session was about to end, the representative from Izky stood up and presented a copy of the First Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine's declaration, and brought forward a motion of formalizing our original laws once again.\n\nWithout much hesitation, the motion was passed unanimously, bringing the start of the Second Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine."

And as the celebration continued, some members of the Carpathian Sich that were formerly in exile have returned to pledge their allegiance to the Republic. Then, President Julian Revay performed a short medal ceremony and honoured these new generals of Carpatho-Ukraine.\n\nThe modest celebration continued, while the common mood is not one of patriotic pride, it was the atmosphere of calmness that dominated the capital."
