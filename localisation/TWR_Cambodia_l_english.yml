twrcamnews.1.t:0 "Cambodian Democrats Win '53"
twrcamnews.1.d:0 "The second Cambodian Election has arrived to the young Indochinese democracy today, as many worried about the future of the nation. General fear among the populace gripped the nation, as conspiracies had become common noise in the capital of Phnom Pehn. However, all worries have seemingly vanished, as the Democratic Party of Cambodia, led by prince Norodom Phurissara, has won the election. The Democratic Party of Cambodia has been a reliable party for the Toronto Accord and Cambodia itself, as the party has generally kept stability in Cambodia while continueing to combat the growing influence of Vietnam, Laos and Thailand."
twrcamnews.1.a:0 "Who cares about Cambodia?"
twrcamnews.1.b:0 "The Cambodian Democracy will stay!"
twrcamnews.2.t:0 "Cambodian Liberals Win '53"
twrcamnews.2.d:0 "News from Cambodia has certainly surprised many political experts on the Indochina region today, as the political juggernaut known as the Cambodian Democratic Party has lost against the smaller Liberal Party of prince Norodom Norindeth. The Liberal Party has generally only found real support among the Khmer elite, members of the royal family and the few French Indochinese left in Cambodia since the Japanese occupation of the region. However, this election the Liberal Party was able to amass much support from the urban regions of Cambodia, securing an electoral victory in their race against the Democrats and Communists. The victory of the Liberal Party has been celebrated in the Commonwealth nations and its Toronto Accord associates, as the Liberal Party has been a generally pro-Accord and pro-French party."

twrcamnews.3.t:0 "Sangkum Wins '53"
twrcamnews.3.d:0 "News from Cambodia confirms that Sangkum, the royalist, socialist organisation led by former Thai monarch Norodom Sihanouk, has won the Election of 1953. Norodom Sihanouk, Fifth Norodom King of Cambodia, had previously been tied to his crown politically, due to the British influenced constitution of Cambodia adopted in 1949 during the British Mandate. Tired by his chains, Sihanouk had abdicated his throne, leaving it to his still-living father, Norodom Suramarit. Using his new found freedom, Sihanouk formed the Sangkum Reastr Niyum (Khmer for 'Community of the Common People'), A movement that incorporates several parties, such as the VN-EP of Dap Chhuon and the Khmer Renovation Party of Lon Nol, making it a big tent party could easily collapse, with the authoritarian nature of Norodom worsening the situation."
twrcamnews.3.a:0 "Who cares about Cambodia?"
twrcamnews.3.b:0 "I came, I saw, I abdicated!"
twrcamnews.4.t:0 "Pracheachon Wins '53"
twrcamnews.4.d:0 "News from Phnom Pehn tells that the Socialist Krom Pracheachon led by Hou Min has won the Cambodian Election of 1953. The KP, having been a guerilla movement for most of its existence, has been generally known to have great connections with the Viet Minh and the Pathet Lao, which led to the well known conspiracy theory that the party is funded by Vietnam and Laos in an effort to overthrow Cambodian democracy. Similair theories also connect the party to the Communist Party of Kampuchea, an organisation criminalized since the British Mandate.\n\nThe KP now enjoys the majority in the House of the People, but not in the House of the Prestigious due to their lack of high-class support. This discrepancy has led to a political struggle, which the Democrats will most likely exploit."
twrcamnews.4.a:0 "Should we now care about Cambodia?"
twrcamnews.4.b:0 "Let's hope it does not get out of hand."
twrcamnews.6.t:0 "The Cambodian Civil War"
twrcamnews.6.d:0 "The recent establishment of Democratic Kampuchea was a shock to the region, as the last Indochinese Capitalist Regime fell against the Communists. The main shock came in the fact that the CPK met little to no resistance during their coup, having led many to believe that the army was either ill-prepared for any civilian unrest, or that the army was in on the coup and supported the communist forces. However, the second theory has been proven wrong.\n\nUnder the command of Marshal Lon Nol and Sam Sary, the Cambodian Armed Forces have declared an end to the monarchy and the communist government, proclaiming the beginning of the Khmer Republic. Their forces have already secured the Eastern Regions of Cambodia due to its thick jungles. Lon Nol is currently supported by many foreign interest."

########Country Event

twrcambodia.1.t:0 "The 1953 Cambodian Election"
twrcambodia.1.d:0 "A sphere of tension has spanned across Cambodia once again, as the second election in our history is finally upon us. The long campaigning period has been wrapped up last month and the people are now waiting to vote for their prefered party and prime minister. While the great Democratic Party seems rather sure of their victory on the outside, many higher members are scared of the possibility of a Sangkum victory. The careful democracy built during the brief British mandate of Cambodia could all come crashing down if Sihanouk would win this election, as his autocratic ambitions are rather clear to the party elites. At the same time, democrats also fear the rising popularity of the Krom Pracheachon, as its ties with the communist underground could also endanger Cambodian liberalism. In a last speech to the public, Phurissara has defended democracy with passion, emboldened by the spirit of his comrades. While the thunderous applaus he recieved still echoed through the streets of Phnom Pehn, Phurissara was clearly still worried about Cambodia's future."
twrcambodia.1.a:0 "Do not worry, as the Democrats have won!"
twrcambodia.1.b:0 "The Liberal Party has won!"
twrcambodia.1.c:0 "The Sangkum has won!"
twrcambodia.1.e:0 "The Krom Pracheachon!"
twrcambodia.2.t:0 "End of Democrat Dominance"
twrcambodia.2.d:0 "The recent election has led to another party winning the majority in the House of the People, thus ending the era of Democratic Party dominance in the Kingdom of Cambodia. With the end of such an era, many wonder what Cambodia can expect next, as the clouds of reform seem to form around Phnom Pehn."
twrcambodia.2.a:0 "Okay"
twrcambodia.3.t:0 "Abdication of Sihanouk"
twrcambodia.3.d:0 "Frustation to no end is the best way to describe the current soul of the Cambodian monarch, Norodom Sihanouk. Sihanouk was given the throne after his 19th birthday by the French governor general of Indochina and has ruled over Cambodia during the Japanese occupation and the Japanese-pressured era of independence. As a young king, Sihanouk had no interest in politics, but something seemingly changed in him during the period of independence, as he became the main problem the British had to solve during the period of the British Mandate. Having had a taste of power, Sihanouk wanted more and was not interested in a constitution, forcing the British to place him under house arrest during the remaining 4 years of the mandate. Today, the king has no power and is a mere figurehead, something that has brought great discomfort to Sihanouk, who seeks more power to enrich himself and his followers. Thus, Sihanouk has announced his abdication from the Cambodian throne, as to give him the opportunity to formulate a new political movement, known as the Sangkum."
twrcambodia.3.a:0 "Let him abdicate, his father was a better man anyway"
twrcambodia.3.b:0 "That's not possible, Sihanouk"
twrcambodia.4.t:0 "The Samouth Plot"
twrcambodia.4.d:0 "Unbelievable shock has paralyzed the people of Cambodia, as the illegal Communist Party of Kampuchea has joined the socialist Krom Pracheachon in a civil coup overthrowing the established parliamentary democracy. The coup, led by Tou Samouth, Pol Pot and Son Ngoc Minh, has already taken a hold over the capital of Cambodia and its surrounding countryside, having effectively taken the monarchy hostage. While Samouth's plot has worked out for the communist party, resistance is far from snuffed out. The Cambodian armed forces, for example, are still loyal to the democratic kingdom and have thus started rebelling in the eastern provinces."
twrcambodia.4.a:0 "And as such, capitalism is no more in Indochina"
twrcambodia.5.t:0 "Establishment of Kampuchea"
twrcambodia.5.d:0 "With the celebration of the communist coup also came the administrative and ideological problems we had yet to face. One of these is the reorganization of the state into a socialist state, as to build the road to our communist utopia. The main idea, which has its roots in the urban branch of the party, is the establishment of Kampuchea, keeping the monarchy as a powerless figurehead and unifying symbol of the people of Cambodia. This Kampuchea would be led by the party general-secretary of the CPK as a Head of State and an elected prime minister as Head of Government. This idea has been mainly the brain child of Tou Samouth, due to his experience in the urban party branch, though some of the more radical fringes of the party disagree with this way of thinking, such as the lesser known Pol Pot and his radical traditional communists, which belief that the city is a symbol of bourgeoisie oppression and a historical expression of capitalist exploitation, mostly seen in the former European colonies."
twrcambodia.5.a:0 "Kampuchea will be our way forward!"
twrcambodia.6.t:0 "Question of the Monarchy"
twrcambodia.6.d:0 "The establishment of Democratic Kampuchea has gone hand in hand with the following question: \n'Should we keep the monarchy of Cambodia intact as a spirtual figurehead of the nation?' \nThe question may not seem as straight forward as one may think, as the king of Cambodia has not only been rather open to cooperation with the communist party, but the Communist Party of Kampuchea has a large following that still does not want to get rid of our king. While the radical fringes of the movement have made it clear that they would prefer the monarchy gone, our majority does not follow their ideas."
twrcambodia.6.a:0 "The monarchy is an integral part of Kampuchea"
twrcambodia.6.b:0 "A monarchy is the most basic form of despotic capitalism!"
twrcambodia.7.t:0 "Cambodian Armed Forces revolt"
twrcambodia.7.d:0 "With our recent and daring coup against the former capitalist government, come the consequences of such a brazen move: The armed forces, still loyal to the former capitalist government and staunchly anti-communist, have unified into a military coalition waging their own conflict in the eastern jungles of Cambodia. Their cause is clearly supported by the Thai monarchy and American contacts, as they hold equipment far more modern than the Cambodian armed forces used previously according to official government documents. With them now openly revolting in the east and on our Thai border, our people's army has to respond quick to this problem."
twrcambodia.7.a:0 "We won't miss our chance for revolution!"

#######Ideas 
CAM_democrat_dominance:0 "Democrat Dominance"
CAM_democrat_dominance_desc:0 "The Democratic Party of Cambodia has been the major political monolith of the nation since its independence in 1950 from the British Empire. As a social democratic party, the Democrats have tried to bring prosperity to Cambodia and reform its economy to a modern, capitalist one instead of its current agricultural sector dominance. The party, led by the known Yem Sambaur, has its radical communist fringes led by Ieng Sary, but Sambaur has generally been able to keep these under control with the support of his followers. The Democratic Party has also been able to keep the autocratic Sihanouk in check, but many do fear that the current cracks in the party, as well as the young democratic traditions of Cambodia can quickly crumble due to the continued political pressure of the opposition, the communist guerillas, our Indochinese neighbours, Thai expansionism and the ongoing cold war between America and the German Reich."
CAM_USA_guns:0 "Guns from the U.S.A."
CAM_USA_guns_desc:0 "The Cambodian Military saw its establishment during the British mandate of the Cambodian Kingdom (1946-1950). Supported by British and American advisors, a generation of commanders learned about western tactics and strategy and were inspired by the historical Khmer doctrines. This establishment has left us with a rather modern, though inexperienced, military. However, a big problem of our current army is the American influence present. All of our right-wing military high command has a hatred for anti-American ideologies, such as Nazism and Communism. All of our equipment is made in American factories and sold by American businessmen across the Pacific Ocean. All of our personnel have close ties with the American military. In conclusion: Our sovereignty and military is completely influenced by the United States, something Sihanouk fears the most."
