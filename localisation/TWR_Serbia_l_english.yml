#Description
 
 SER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Serbia sits at the crossroads of the Balkans once again. Swiftly occupied by the Third Reich in 1941, partisan movements with a diverse range of loyalties immediately began resisting the occupation. Placing the pro-Axis general Milan Nedic in charge of the collaborationist government, many had hoped that once the war ended that peace could finally return to Serbia, however Nedic's unexpected death in 1950 threw this into question as Milan Acimovic reluctantly took charge of a now deeply-resented regime. As 1952 rolls around, it may only be a matter of time before the guerrilla war boils over into a full-blown rebellion."

#### Leader Description ####
 Acimovic_desc:0 "Born in 1898, Milan Aćimović became an accomplished lawyer in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Having expressed anti-communist and fascist sympathies, he and his future collaborationist compatriot Velibor Jonić fought to legalize Zbor; the primary fascist party in Yugoslavia. Having been jailed in 1940 for his axis sympathies, he was released from captivity by the Nazis and asked to form a Serbian civilian regime in the new rump state that emerged from the Axis partition of Yugoslavia. While nominally the prime minister of the "Government of National Salvation", A German detachment lead by Harald Turner and a delicate web of loyal Chetnik and ZBOR politicians are the only things that prevent his nation from descending into complete anarchy. As the partisans and rebellious Chetniks continue to terrorize the countryside regardless, Milan's Serbia is hardly a functioning government."
 Strahinja_Janjic_desc:0 "Born on April 13, 1906 in the Mačva district in the village of Klenje, Strahinja Janjić was an ordinary child who frequently abused animals for fun. Too young to participate in the First World War, he joined the pre-war Yugoslav army in 1923 and by the time he was fired in 1932, he held the rank of officer. He later tried to find a job in the public sector and in the period from 1936 to 1939, he changed many jobs, where he was fired for those same sadistic tendencies.\n\nHaving been described by many mentally insane, unstable, aggressive, sadistic and pathologically disturbed, Janjić reached the position of mayor of Kragujevac in 1941, but due to his too aggressive policy and behavior, he was fired on the orders of Milan Nedić and arrested. It wasn't until the intervention of the Germans that he was released and transferred to Leskovac. After his release, the Germans assigned him to form the Belgrade secret police in 1942. Also known as the  1st Belgrade special combat detachment, or as Janjić called it, the "Serbian Gestapo".\n\nTaught by the Germans, Janjić fantasized about overthrowing Nedić and becoming the leader of a National Socialist Serbian state."
 SER_Svetozar_Necak_desc2:0 "Absolutely nothing is known about him, nor about his birth, the place of birth of his childhood, his participation in the First World War, his interwar life and what he did before the German invasion of Yugoslavia.\n\nBut we know one thing for sure about this cold-blooded murderer who, together with Strahinja Janjić, participated in the creation of the 1st Belgrade Special Fighting Division. As Janjić's deputy, he personally participated in various crimes against their precieved enemies. But unlike his boss, he is more sane.\n\nWhen Janjić left for Tibet, Svetozar has taken the role of Head of State until he returns from his expedition."
 SER_Svetozar_Necak_desc:0 "Absolutely nothing is known about him, nor about his birth, the place of birth of his childhood, his participation in the First World War, his interwar life and what he did before the German invasion of Yugoslavia.\n\nBut we know one thing for sure about this cold-blooded murderer who, together with Strahinja Janjić, participated in the creation of the 1st Belgrade Special Fighting Division. As Janjić's deputy, he personally participated in various crimes against their precieved enemies. But unlike his boss, he is more sane.\n\nWhen Janjić eventually died, Svetozar has since taken the reigns of the party in the hopes of undoing at least some of the damage."
 Dimitrije_Ljotic_desc:0 "Born on August 12, 1891 in Belgrade, Ljotić's father was a well-known politician and consul in Greece, as well as the first man to translate Karl Marx's "Communist Manifesto" into Serbian. Dimitrije Ljotić took part in the Balkan wars, as well as the First World War fighting for Serbia. He graduated from the Faculty of Law and continued to practice law until the interwar period.\n\nDuring his studies, Ljotić was introduced to the fascist ideas of Charles Maurras in Paris, whose writings enthralled the impressionable Ljotić. In 1920, he joined the People's Radical Party of Nikola Pašić, an early far-right party in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1930 he became the deputy president of the Smederevo district and climbed through the rank, eventually meeting King Alexander and offered him a draft of his constitution that depicted an organic fascist dictatorship; A proposal that the king promptly rejected.\n\nIn the immediate wake of the king's assassination in 1934, Ljotić contacted three fascist parties in Yugoslavia, and at a joint session they merged into the United Fighting Organization of Workers also known as ZBOR. Immediately after the formation they were banned, and never numbered over 10,000 members. After the German invasion, he received an offer to find himself in the future Nedić's place, but refused, becoming a member of the government and got the right to organize the state's volunteer forces.\nNow in charge of Serbia, he faces hard opposition from most Serbians from both the former government and the civilian populace. Something that he will have to remedy in order to survive."
 Dragoljub_Mihailovic_desc:0 "Born on April 26, 1893 in Ivanjica, he was left without parents at a relatively young age, as his uncle took care of him and his relatives. Dragoljub finished the first four grades of primary school, and enrolled in the Third Belgrade Gymnasium, only to later transfer to the lower military academy, from where he was transferred to the front in the Balkan wars. Mihailović stood out as a particularly brave and competent soldier in several significant operations of the first and second Balkan wars. Continuing his military education, he was eventually sent to the front against Austria-Hungary during the First World War.\n\nAfter the war, he was sent to quell the Albanian uprisings in Kosovo, and was originally placed in the King's Guard, but was removed after rehearsing a gun in a full bar and saying "There is no greater Serb than me." He participated in various diplomatic and military missions in the interwar period, which gained him a considerable reputation. He was first sent to teach at military schools in Sarajevo and eventually enrolled in a French military school, where he shared a desk with Charles de Gaulle. He was later transferred to Sofia as a military attaché, but after a few years was transferred to Prague.\n\nAt the outbreak of the invasion of Yugoslavia, he retreated into the woods, and waited for the right moment to revolt. One of the few who decided to continue the fight, Dragoljub maintained contacts with Milan Aćimović and the Government of National Salvation. Now in charge of Serbia, his regime has taken on hard Serbian nationalism, and many believe that his Junta of Saint Sava may continue the status quo of old."
 Bozidar_Puric_desc:0 "Born on February 19, 1891 in Serbia. Nothing is known about his childhood and war years, but it is believed that he participated in the First World War. During the interwar period, he worked as a diplomat in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, mainly in the United States and France as an ambassador. \n\nWhile in Serbia, he advocated the ideas of conservatism with indications of the liberalization of institutions, only more directed towards democratization. Taking over the government-in-exile stationed in London after the invasion, Božidar became enamoured with the democratic ideas of Great Britain and its constitutional monarchy, something that he hopes to bring to a wartorn Serbia."
 SER_Milos_Trifunovic_desc:0 "Born on October 30, 1871 in Užice, he graduated Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade. His role in the First World War is unknown, but it is assumed that he took part in it. In 1903, he was constantly elected a Member of the National Assembly. During the interwar period, he was elected Minister of Education several times, and advocated for the liberalization of institutions and education reform, making it a priority.\n\nPromptly fleeing in the wake of the invasion of Yugoslavia, he later became a member of the government in exile. Now in charge of a democratic Yugoslavia, Trifunović has promised extensive education to reshape the nation into a truly modernized force, but whether he can accomplish this remains to be seen."
 SER_Zivko_Topalovic_desc:0 "Born on March 21, 1886 in Užice, his childhood remains a mystery. After the end of the First World War, he founded the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia in 1921. coming into conflict with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Energetic, resourceful, intelligent, withdrawn and shy, he is frequently hailed as a fighter for human rights and worker's rights.\n\nHaving been close friends with Dragoljub Mihailović, his reputation amongst liberal and fellow left-wing elements in the state is by far his greatest obstacle for the future. Something that he hopes to fix for the sake of the state and its king."
 Aleksandar_Rankovic_desc:0 "Born in Draževac on November 28, 1909, he moved to Belgrade where he got a job and later joined labour unions. Joining the Communist Party of Yugoslavia while in the unions, he had been frequently arrested by the government as a member of an illegal party. After his release from prison, he continued with his communist affairs, and became a senior official within the party. After the invasion of Yugoslavia, he joined Josip Broz Tito and the Communist Party in the underground partisan movement.\n\nA staunch Stalinist and Serb nationalist, Ranković has long advocated for a solid centralized Soviet system overseen by the secret police. Now in charge of the Communist Party, he may very well see his vision go from ideas on paper into laws in practice."
 Josip_Broz_desc:0 "Born on May 7, 1892 in the village of Kumrovec, he was a locksmith by trade. During his search for a job at an early age, he toured Czechoslovakia where he stayed for a short time at Skoda Works, then later moved to Berlin and finally returned to Austria-Hungary where he worked until his conscription into the Austro-Hungarian army. At the outbreak of the First World War, he was transferred to the Serbian front, but after unsuccessful invasions, in 1915 he was transferred to Galicia where he fought against the Russians, only to be captured and transferred to the Urals iin a labour camp. Having been released during the Russian Revolution, he returned to Yugoslavia in 1918, and soon joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Originally a propaganda minister, he soon became its commissioner in 1937, and eventually party president in 1939.\n\nAfter the war broke out, his troops retreated to the forests in what became known as the partisan movement.\n\nJosip Broz 'Tito' has now become the unquestionable ruler of Yugoslavia, the future of the Balkans remains uncertain as ever."
 Milovan_Djilas_desc:0 "Born in Podbišće near Mojkovac on June 4, 1911, Đilas went to Belgrade after completing his undergraduate studies to study philosophy and law, eventually joining the CPY. Tito found out about him later around 1937, and a directive was issued to find Milovan Đilas and bring him to organize the sending of volunteers to Spain during its civil war. At the beginning of the Second World War, Đilas was sent to his native Montenegro, where an uprising was to take place but famously failed.\n\nĐilas' ideology varies far from Tito's and is in conflict with anything in the hardline communist camp. A self-proclaimed democratic socialist, he has been considered by many to be the true reformist voice within the party. Something that he now wishes to bring to the new Republic."
 SER_Council_of_Communists_desc:0 "In the midst of the elections in SKOJ, the Council of Communists, which represents the internal body of the CPY, offered to serve as a transitional power that will try to lead the state until the campaigns are over and the new leader is determined."
 SER_Anarchy_desc:0 "Janjić and his tyranny are dead! The nephew is dead! The whole branch of his loyal figures are also no longer with us. Anarchy reigned in the streets, while robberies, murders and rapes continue. Until the situation calms down during this mess, no one will be able to take a secure position in power in Serbia. For now, we are lost, we just don't know if we will be lost forever."
 SER_Tanasije_Dinic_desc:0 "Born on April 15, 1891, Dinić dealt with military matters, and later joined the army. Not much is known about his past, but several significant things are known that have shaped his views as well as politics. Working in the army as a lieutenant-colonel, he was pro-British in nature, and was associated with several agents stationed in Yugoslavia. After the outbreak of the European War, and later the attack on Yugoslavia, he joined Milan Nedić as Minister of the Interior as head of social policy and health. His motives are largely unknown, however his rule is not believed to last long as the tides of revolution creep on Belgrade's doorstep."

Nedić has very recently passed, officially from health complications, and the former lawyer Aćimović has succeeded him. The state is tearing itself apart from the seams with irredentists under many different names and banners from the Yugo Royalists to the Serbian national socialists and everything in-between.

 SER_Matters_of_Terrorism_desc:0 "Since at least 1941 multiple terrorist elements, mostly radical Judeo-Bolsheviks and their lackeys, have been threatening the stability of our country and its relatively unstable government. They have performed countless terrorist attacks throughout our territory and have a strong influence in the region of Užice. President Aćimović has determined it a necessity to ally one of the competing paramilitaries to remove an enemy while making an ally of their competitor. Which shall have his ear?"
 SER_Call_upon_the_Ljoticevci:0 "Call upon the Ljotićevci"
 SER_Call_upon_the_Ljoticevci_desc:0 "Before the war began, Milan Aćimović fought to legalize the ZBOR (United Militant Labour Organization) with his ideological comrade Ljotić against the former Royal Dictatorship in 1935. All that progress was lost and Milan was jailed for having pro-axis sympathies by the western coup's government. After the liberation of our country from the western coup, many excitedly joined up with The Serbian Volunteer corps to help our allies in Germania. We believed that our new alliance would be genuine and that Germany would return the whole of our territory to us. We were wrong, now over two-thirds of our nation was lost to secession and created the current mess that we are in. Ljotić has always been regarded by his colleagues as a strange character that would never be a leader of a nation, which is perfect for us. It would only be the natural decision to return to a political comrade and let any bygones be bygones, especially if he's got an army to offer."
 SER_Cleansing_Kraljevo:0 "Cleansing Kraljevo"
 SER_Cleansing_Kraljevo_desc:0 "In 1941 the Wehrmacht performed anti-partisan activities in the city of Kraljevo that resulted in the deaths of around 2000 of our citizens. The Germans were arbitrary and inconsiderate in their task of cleansing the area from partisan influences, resulting in the deceased being almost entirely ethnically Serbian with 40 of the executed having been a part of our ZBOR! The intention to rid Kraljevo of the foreign degeneracy of Tito's Partisans and those damned Chetniks is one we intend to finish. Let us give Kraljevo a breath of fresh air."
 SER_The_Hearts_and_Minds_of_Nis:0 "The Hearts and Minds of Niš"
 SER_The_Hearts_and_Minds_of_Nis_desc:0 "During the second great war the Germans established their first camp in Niš to "assist" in riding our country of Jewish-Bolshevik influences. While the goal was noble, their implementation was poor and has left scars on the people of Niš. While discussing the camps and their effects Publicly wouldn't be the best idea, because of our complacency with them during the war, we can now embrace again our Narod back into the fold of the nation. With the help of the ZBOR, we can return Yugoslav rule and hope to Niš. Young boys look with starry eyes at the tall sharply dressed men of the Volunteer Corps who enthusiastically assist in rebuilding their home. Many are given lessons in new state-owned schools on the effects of Judeo-Bolshevism and how the partisans are violent psychopaths that want to continue the war. The parents, especially those that were in the camps, are more apprehensive about the new education standards and patrolling Ljotićevci but find no regret in finally having food, money, labor and security for their families again."
 SER_Pacifying_Uzice:0 "Pacifying Užice"
 SER_Pacifying_Uzice_desc:0 "During the second great war, communist partisans and their lackeys captured the city of Užice to establish a short-lived partisan state. They set up obdoris or "people's councils" which indoctrinated many of our young and impressionable Yugoslavian youth. This must be corrected if we are to ever return full rule to the city of Užice and reclaim the pride of our nation. Paramilitary forces are conducting operations in the city to correct the misunderstandings of the world which the youth have and counteract insurgent activities of the partisans. Užice shall return to the nation by our terms."
 SER_Protection_from_Banat_raiders:0 "Protection from Banat Raiders"
 SER_Protection_from_Banat_raiders_desc:0 "After the end of the war the bastard state of Banat was stolen from us by a rather weak justification from the Germans of "strategic importance". This alone was an issue but these same bastards decided it a good idea to mistreat our narod in these lands by raiding local villages and nearby ones within our borders. To protect our people from these madmen of no direction, we must fortify the settlements bordering this rogue state and establish lookout positions to better monitor the activities of the Swabians. Not one Pomeranian grenadier shall march further into our home."
 SER_Call_upon_the_Mihailovic:0 "Call upon the Mihailović"
 SER_Call_upon_the_Mihailovic_desc:0 "Milan always considered himself to genuinely love his People and the identity of a Yugoslavian. A dear friend of his, Dragoljub "Draža" Mihailović, shared this love but they had a difficult relationship due to political issues and the hatred the Germans had for Mihailović. Milan has always treated his friend well, saving his life on at least 1 occasion, and while he had issues with the former royal dictatorship there was much more common ground between himself and the chetniks than the partisans of Tito. Mihailović is also a decorated war hero of multiple wars and a legend to all who follow the Ravna Gora movement. We should allow Mihailović more influence in our government so that we may make better use of his Chetniks."
 SER_Reinforce_the_Countryside:0 "Reinforce the Countryside"
 SER_Reinforce_the_Countryside_desc:0 "The Germans made some level of effort to keep peace in the cities but they have left the countryside to the hounds of Tito and his communist goons. The Chetniks can be deployed to these ignored regions to better fight the Partisan influence and reinforce the smaller villages to prevent these partisan attacks. Many of these villages welcome the Chetniks with open arms to save them from the cruelty of the Godless communists. It helps that many of the Chetniks are from these small villages and personally know many of the villagers that they are assigned to protect. They attend church together and pray for the return of the monarch to bring peace to Yugoslavia. With such dedication as this, it is no doubt that God is a Serb."
 SER_Marching_through_Obrenovac:0 "Marching through Obrenovac"
 SER_Marching_through_Obrenovac_desc:0 "The influence of the Chetniks in our government has grown significantly to the point that a march has been organized in the old municipality of Obrenovac in the capital, Belgrade. Named after Prince Miloš Obrenović, the supporters of the Ravna Gora movement chant slogans that denounce both the occupying Germans and the partisans as enemies of The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. They demand the Return of the Karađorđević dynasty, the expulsion of the Germans and fulfilment of the Yugoslavian dream that has been decades in the making. God may be a Serb, but Yugoslavia is his Kingdom."
 SER_Our_military_status:0 "Our Military Status"
 SER_Our_military_status_desc:0 "We must be honest with ourselves and acknowledge that our military is not one to rival any powers in Europe currently. The weapons, uniforms, boots, morale, and pay of our soldiers is substandard currently and must be corrected. We must make the standards of our army comparable to or better than any who may challenge it. An expansion of the NCO corps of the Yugoslavian Army is needed to ensure this standard is kept along with an increase in pay and benefits for our hardy soldiers. Weapons testing of German, partisan, British, American, and other captured munitions is being done with the desire to create our unique weapon system that will outperform all of its competitors. Camouflage is becoming a more common sight with patterns currently in testing. Though the current optics may be bleak, there is hope on the Horizon for the military of Yugoslavia."
 SER_The_Pancevo_Incident:0 "State Visit to Pančevo"
 SER_The_Pancevo_Incident_desc:0 "To the surprise of president Aćimović, none other than Sepp Janko of the pseudostate of Banat has requested a meeting in Pančevo to negotiate the return of territory to us. This proposition has excited the president, with him already requesting maps showing Banat as returned to our nation. A peaceful resolution to this multi-year long conflict while expanding his country and making a prestigious deal is the single best bit of news Milan has received in quite some time. He eagerly packs for and plans the meeting."

We never had room for a real navy fleet that would be local except for a couple of ships used to lay mines so our fleet consisted of purchased ships made primarily by the British and French. We will organize a new navy based on the same principles as in the interwar period, only we will put more emphasis on ships that will serve during the war because that was one of our weak points during the invasion at the same time as poor coordination of fleets that were under our control. But the war brought one problem - the Italians and the Germans kidnapped almost the entire navy and we were left with only a river patrol circling Kalemegdan, catching fishermen who break the law. With the return of the coastal provinces on the Adriatic Sea, we will guarantee a new Navy, which this time will properly oppose the invasion and establish Serbian control over the Adriatic Sea."

With coordination between air and ground forces, we can use our air force to disrupt and damage enemy formations and strongholds, making it far easier for our units to break their cohesion and take their positions. As such, supportive efforts by our pilots may prove just as vital as any other part of the air war."

They also rained bombs from above and shot down the relatively few planes we had mercilessly with their efficient engines of death. This is as much a lesson as it is a tragedy, for by studying it we can learn where our tactics are outdated and where our training of our pilots can be improved. This will allow us to use their deadly precision against them."

Some, especially in Croatia, defected to the fascists and enjoyed the benefits of their traitorous collaboration. However, part of this was being allowed access to German air technology, including that which is now in our possession.

From transport to observation to attack, there's no end to the possible uses for helicopters. Therefore, to be self-reliant in yet another aspect of warfare, we will not only build our helicopters, but we will also build them based on our designs and with our materials.

 twrserbia.1.t:0 "Matters of the State"
 twrserbia.1.d:0 "The Serbian nation has stood against the mightiest conquerors of history, and each time the Serbian spirit was never extinguished. When the Kingdom of Yugoslavia emerged from the ashes of the Great War, it was a weak and unstable union; eventually falling under the dictatorial rule of King Alexander I. Having openly defied Axis influence in 1941, our great nation was subsequently backstabbed by individuals desiring to carve out ethnonationalism fiefdoms as the regime collapsed. Hoping to bring some semblance of independence and stability to our shattered nation, Milan Nedic and his deputy Milan Acimovic forged a 'Government of National Salvation' with German backing. Following Nedic's resignation in 1950 due to ill health, Acimovic has assumed power of the unstable rump Serbian state."
 twrserbia.1.a:0 "For God and the Fatherland!"

 twrserbia.2.t:0 "Matters of the Economy"
 twrserbia.2.d:0 "The Serbian economy, while principally agrarian, was completely devastated by the German invasion of 1941. What little urban development we had was destroyed in Luftwaffe bombings, as the countryside was terrorized by bandits and terrorists alike. With our government requiring significant economic aid from the German Reich, a significant trade deficit has only gotten worse over the past decade. If Serbia is ever to become a truly independent state again, we must tend to our economy."
 twrserbia.2.a:0 "The cities are our priority."
 twrserbia.2.b:0 "We should help the countryside."

 twrserbia.3.t:0 "Matters of Terrorism"
 twrserbia.3.d:0 "The largest problem in the Government of National Salvation is by far the incredibly unstable countryside. While the German garrison can maintain some semblance of order in the big cities, Serbia's many small towns and villages are rife with conflict. Communist bandits and rebellious Chetniks alike terrorize the nation's backbone, and it must come to an end if we are ever to finally achieve peace. Draza Mihalovic, while considered a wanted terrorist by the Germans, has offered his services to the government in exchange for more influence. The fascist Ljotic has also thrown his hat into the ring, offering his party's paramilitary force in ending the communist threat. Ultimately, the decision lies with President Acimovic, but whoever he favors will undoubtedly shake up Serbia's balance of power."
 twrserbia.3.a:0 "Zbor can handle this."
 twrserbia.3.b:0 "The Chetniks are our safest option."

 twrserbia.4.t:0 "Pancevo Incident"
 twrserbia.4.d:0 "In what was expected to be a fairly uneventful function, President Acimovic visited the city of Pancevo in the neighboring Schutzstaffel State of Banat. Although officially Serbian on paper, in reality, the region is ruled by Danube Swabians who answer to Heinrich Himmler directly. Driving in an open-top car to meet Banat's Obersturmfuhrer Josef Janko, his motorcade took a wrong turn and wound up in the city's lower-income neighborhood. Out of nowhere, five gunshots were heard from a dark alleyway and Acimovic's uniform lay soaked in blood. As the news of the president's death reached Beograd, the city quickly fell into disorder and chaos. As the unrest intensified, a group of budding soldiers stormed the Parliament Building. When everyone had begun to realize what had happened, the putsch put..."
 twrserbia.4.a:0 "Dinic in charge."
 twrserbia.4.b:0 "Mihailovic in charge."
 twrserbia.4.c:0 "Tito in charge."

 twrserbia.5.t:0 "Partisans Rise!"
 twrserbia.5.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened; As our nation spirals further into chaos, the communist bandits that have long since been a nuisance have taken advantage of us in our weakness! Numerous small towns in Moravia have pledged allegiance to Tito and his band of troublemakers, and numerous armories have been looted by ambitious Partisans. Although we had tried to prevent a large-scale uprising, it appears to have only been a matter of time."
 twrserbia.5.a:0 "Purge the communists once and for all!"
 twrserbia.5.b:0 "Smrt fasizmu, Sloboda narodu!"

 twrserbia.6.t:0 "Partisan Coup!"
 twrserbia.6.d:0 "As turmoil continues to grip Belgrade and the other major cities, the unexpected occurred just outside the Serbian National Assembly. A band of communist partisans stormed the building to the sound of heavy gunfire from inside, attempting to force [ROOT.GetLeader]'s resignation. As the gunfire came to an end, it appeared that..."
 twrserbia.6.a:0 "The communists successfully took over the government!"
 twrserbia.6.b:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader]'s bodyguards routed the communists!"

 twrserbia.7.t:0 "Chetnik Revolt!"
 twrserbia.7.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened; As our nation spirals further into chaos, the monarchist terrorists that have pestered our regime for greater influence have openly opposed us! Numerous small towns in Moravia have pledged allegiance to 'Uncle Draza' and his criminal organization, and numerous armories have been looted by the more ambitious Chetniks. Although we had tried to prevent a large-scale uprising, it appears to have only been a matter of time."
 twrserbia.7.a:0 "The regime must remain united!"
 twrserbia.7.b:0 "For king and the fatherland!"

 twrserbia.8.t:0 "Chetnik Coup!"
 twrserbia.8.d:0 "As turmoil continues to grip Belgrade and the other major cities, the unexpected occurred just outside the Serbian National Assembly. A group of elite Chetnik officers stormed the building to the sound of heavy gunfire from inside, attempting to force [ROOT.GetLeader]'s resignation. As the gunfire came to an end, it appeared that..."
 twrserbia.8.a:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] was toppled!"
 twrserbia.8.b:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader]'s bodyguards halted the attempted putsch!"

 twrserbia.9.t:0 "Fascist Uprising!"
 twrserbia.9.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened; As our nation spirals further into chaos, the fascist paramilitaries that have long since been gradually growing their power base have backstabbed us! Numerous small towns in Moravia have pledged allegiance to Ljotic and his party of radicals, and numerous armories have been looted by the Ljoticevci. Although we had tried to prevent a large-scale uprising, it appears to have only been a matter of time."
 twrserbia.9.a:0 "The regime must be united!"
 twrserbia.9.b:0 "The Vodja will rejuvenate Yugoslavia!"

 twrserbia.10.t:0 "Ljotic's Coup!"
 twrserbia.10.d:0 "As turmoil continues to grip Belgrade and the other major cities, the unexpected occurred just outside the Serbian National Assembly. A detachment of Zbor's Ljoticveci stormed the building to the sound of heavy gunfire from inside, attempting to force [ROOT.GetLeader]'s resignation. As the gunfire came to an end, it appeared that.."
 twrserbia.10.a:0 "Coup was successful!"
 twrserbia.10.b:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader]'s bodyguards slaughtered the fascist fanatics!"

 twrserbia.11.t:0 "Serbian Civil War!"
 twrserbia.11.d:0 "Troubling news out of the Balkans today, as the Government of National Salvation's very existence has come under threat. Although under close German trusteeship for over a decade, the Serbian collaboration government lead by the now-dead Milan Acimovic has fallen into complete disorder as communist partisan forces in the countryside have staged a full-scale uprising. Aiming to overthrow the government, revolutionary leader Josip Broz Tito has promised to stop at nothing until all of Yugoslavia has been purged of 'fascist occupiers and traitorous pencil-pushers'."
 twrserbia.11.a:0 "We will win!"
 twrserbia.11.b:0 "The Balkans can never catch a break, can they..."

 twrserbia.12.t:0 "Serbian Civil War!"
 twrserbia.12.d:0 "Troubling news out of the Balkans today, as the Government of National Salvation's very existence has come under threat. Although under close German trusteeship for over a decade, the Serbian collaboration government lead by the now-dead Milan Acimovic has fallen into complete disorder as reactionary monarchist forces loyal to the Yugoslavian government-in-exile staged a large-scale insurrection. Aiming to overthrow the collaborationist government, Chetnik leader Draza Mihalovic has promised to stop at nothing until all of Yugoslavia has been purged of 'treasonous rats and Bolshevik troublemakers'."
 twrserbia.12.a:0 "We will win!"
 twrserbia.12.b:0 "The Balkans can never catch a break, can they..."

 twrserbia.13.t:0 "Serbian Civil War!"
 twrserbia.13.d:0 "Troubling news out of the Balkans today, as the Government of National Salvation's very existence has come under threat. Although under close German trusteeship for over a decade, the Serbian government lead by the now-dead Milan Acimovic has fallen into complete disorder as fascist paramilitary forces belonging to Dimitrije Ljotic in the countryside have openly defied their former allies in the Serbian government. Aiming to usurp the new and ineffectual President Dinic, 'The Vodja' as Ljotic stylizes himself as has vowed to liberate all of Yugoslavia from the 'Judeo-Masonic specter' that has left it in complete devastation."
 twrserbia.13.a:0 "We will win!"
 twrserbia.13.b:0 "The Balkans can never catch a break, can they..."

 twrserbia.14.t:0 "End of the Civil War"
 twrserbia.14.d:0 "It appears that peace, no matter how fragile it may be, has returned to the Balkans for now. As the final garrisons loyal to the enemy have fallen, it's now clear who reigns supreme over the troubled country of Serbia. Having waged a guerrilla campaign for over a decade, Tito's communist partisans now reign supreme over the collaborators and reactionaries. Proclaiming a nationwide anti-fascist revolution against "All those who dare subjugate the Yugoslavian peoples", Tito's calls for Brotherhood & Unity can no longer be ignored."
 twrserbia.14.d_2:0 "It appears that peace, no matter how fragile it may be, has returned to the Balkans for now. As the final garrisons loyal to the enemy have fallen, it's now clear who reigns supreme over the troubled country of Serbia. Having waged a limited guerrilla campaign for over a decade, Mihalovic's Chetnik movement now reigns supreme over the collaborators and communists. Proclaiming a 'Nationalist war of reclamation', it would indeed appear that advocates of Yugoslavia's old order are once again back in charge after years of occupation."
 twrserbia.14.d_3:0 "It appears that peace, no matter how fragile it may be, has returned to the Balkans for now. As the final garrisons loyal to the enemy have fallen, it's now clear who reigns supreme over the troubled country of Serbia. Having backstabbed the collaborationist government in its time of weakness, Ljtoic's fascist Zbor party now reigns supreme over the western lackeys and communists. Proclaiming a 'National Rebirth of the Yugoslavian peoples', there is no doubt that the brown shade of fascism will continue to haunt the region for years to come."
 twrserbia.14.a:0 "We have won, but at what cost?"

 twrserbia.15.t:0 "Chetnik Raid!"
 twrserbia.15.d:0 "Chetnik rebels have raided one of our supply depots and killed a small handful of soldiers in the process! This move will not only strengthen their ranks but embolden them to take more serious actions in the future."
 twrserbia.15.a:0 "Damnation!"

 twrserbia.16.t:0 "Successful Raid against Chetniks"
 twrserbia.16.d:0 "Our counterterrorism methods appear to have some semblance of success, as a Chetnik resistance cell finally cracked. A handful of officers loyal to the exiled king have been round up and subsequently shot."
 twrserbia.16.a:0 "Splendid!"

 twrserbia.17.t:0 "Failed Raid against Chetniks"
 twrserbia.17.d:0 "In an embarrassing series of events, the detachment of our gendarmerie were slaughtered attempting to destroy a Chetnik resistance cell."
 twrserbia.17.a:0 "Execute somebody for this!"

 twrserbia.18.t:0 "Partisan Raid!"
 twrserbia.18.d:0 "Yugoslavian partisans have one of our supply depots and killed a small handful of soldiers in the process! This move will not only strengthen their ranks but embolden them to take more serious actions in the future."
 twrserbia.18.a:0 "Damnation!"

 twrserbia.19.t:0 "Successful Raid against Partisans"
 twrserbia.19.d:0 "Our counterterrorism methods appear to have some semblance of success, as a Partisan terrorist cell finally cracked. A handful of officers loyal to the criminal Josip Broz have been round up and subsequently shot."
 twrserbia.19.a:0 "Splendid!"

 twrserbia.20.t:0 "Failed Raid against Partisans"
 twrserbia.20.d:0 "In an embarrassing series of events, the detachment of our gendarmerie were slaughtered attempting to destroy a Partisan resistance cell."
 twrserbia.20.a:0 "Execute somebody for this!"

 twrserbia.21.t:0 "Ljotic's Speech!"
 twrserbia.21.d:0 "As the regime's incompetence becomes increasingly apparent, many politicians in our National Assembly have been seen meeting with high ranking Zbor party officials. This will undoubtedly result in the swelling of our opposition's ranks."
 twrserbia.21.a:0 "Traitors..."
 
 twrserbia.22.t:0 "Dinic's Trial"
 twrserbia.22.d:0 "TRIAL TRANSCRIPT\n\nTHE PEOPLE'S STATE VS TANASIJE DINIC\n\nCHARGES: High Treason, Crimes Against Humanity, Crimes Against Socialist Doctrine.\n\nSENTENCE: Death By Firing Squad.\n\nCASE SUMMARY: Took control of collaborationist National Salvation regime on 13 August 1950 replacing late traitor Milan Nedic, responsible for continued collaboration with fascist overlords. Known for cooperating with monarchist 'Chetnik' terrorists, perpetrators of banditry activities responsible for the deaths of at least five-thousand Yugoslavians. Defendant refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the court, the charge of contempt of court added to the list of criminal offenses. Sentence carried out after seven hours of testimony from state-selected witnesses. Corpse burned in the courtyard and ashes were dumped in the river Sava. The case is considered closed indefinitely.\n\nSIGNED: Provisional Attorney-General Office of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Marshal Josip Broz Tito."
 twrserbia.22.a:0 "Dead meat."
 
 twrserbia.23.t:0 "SKOJ"
 twrserbia.23.d:0 "The room is set, most of the partisan leaders from Serbia and occupied Yugoslavia has arrived in Belgrade to determine which direction the party will take in the future. Although Serbia has recently fought a bloody civil war that deposed the fascist collaborators, the scars of war continue to haunt the nation, the call for revolutionary action has never been louder. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia has become increasingly divided along ideological lines. While each of the three factions can agree on the need for a socialist revolution across the Balkans, they have been left in a state of perpetual bickering over the implementation of socialism and the status of the multiple ethnicities that make up the nation. The orthodox communists lead by Alexander Rankovic have called for a continuation of hardline Marxist-Leninist principles, promoting a centralized Yugoslavia with an ever-watchful state security apparatus to preserve the revolution. The incumbent faction of pragmatic communists leads by Josip Broz Tito advocate for a more pragmatic approach to the issues of autonomy. Under the slogan of 'Brotherhood and Unity', Marshal Tito's League of Communists argue for a more decentralized model allowing the various ethnicities to become interdependent and equal. Lastly, the moderates under Milovan Djilas have opted for a far more moderate approach to the socialist revolution. Believing that Marxism is bound to destroy Yugoslavia as it had for the Soviet Union, Djilas' Yugoslavian United Front wishes to make amends with the exiled reformist faction of the communist party and introduce market socialism to Yugoslavia. The Socialist Liberation Committee of Yugoslavia will undoubtedly decide the fate of not just Serbia, but perhaps the entire turbulent region of the Balkans."
 twrserbia.23.a:0 "Marshal Tito will bring us to freedom!"
 twrserbia.23.b:0 "Alexander Rankovic will lead Yugoslavia to victory!"
 twrserbia.23.c:0 "Milovan Djilas' reformism will preserve Yugoslavia!"
 
 twrserbia.24.t:0 "Tito's Speech"
 twrserbia.24.d:0 "As the committee gathers in Belgrade's National Assembly for the first hearings on Yugoslavia's future, the incumbent leader of the communist partisans Josip Broz Tito took to the stand to announce the beginning of the congress. 'Comrades of all Yugoslavians! We stand here today not just as antifascist revolutionaries, but as Slavic brothers and sisters united in a common struggle for peace. For years, fascists have drained our people dry to the point of servitude and almost-complete annihilation. As we stand now in the liberated zone of Serbia, we must begin looking outwards to our Yugoslavian comrades stuck under the jackboot of fascism. By promoting harmonious codependence on all peoples of Yugoslavia, our socialist state will finally prosper with the fruits of peace and socialism; both at home and abroad!'"
 twrserbia.24.a:0 "The room erupts in applause."
 
 twrserbia.25.t:0 "Rankovic's Speech"
 twrserbia.25.d:0 "Next up on the speaking list is Alexander Rankovic of the orthodox Leninist faction. Walking in front of the podium and briefly clearing his throat, he begins. 'Comrades-in-arms, there is no doubt at all that the great Marshal Tito has brought us to the first stage of our national communist revolution. However, we must also think about the future. While we may secure our place as the sole leader of South Slavic communism, there are those from within and abroad who wish to undermine everything our Yugoslavian brothers and sisters hope to accomplish! To protect our great nation and its people, we must utilize the state's resources to protecting both the people and the socialist revolution. As late comrade Beria taught us, there can only be true peace in security.'"
 twrserbia.25.a:0 "Very well."
 
 twrserbia.26.t:0 "Djilas' Speech"
 twrserbia.26.d:0 "Last on the speaking list is Milovan Djilas, the democratic socialist reformer. While disliked by his more hardline peers, Djilas is nonetheless a vital figure in keeping the Partisans together. Speaking to the committee, Djilas denounces Alexander Rankovic for his hardline leanings. 'Comrades, friends all, what you have just heard before me is exactly the kind of attitude that has brought the Soviet Union to complete ruin in its noble fight against fascism. If we are to ever prosper as a united Yugoslavia, we must tighten our belts and grit our teeth in the promotion of socialism. We cannot possibly hope to survive in the nation's current state without at least bending a few rules in communist theory, and that is exactly what must be done. If the history of socialist states is anything to consider, a bloated state will always be a failed state!'"
 twrserbia.26.a:0 "How controversial..."
 
 twrserbia.27.t:0 "Election Day"
 twrserbia.27.d:0 "As the final votes were tallied, it appears that the Socialist Liberation Committee has voted overwhelmingly in favor of keeping Josip Broz Tito as leader of the Communist Party. In his acceptance speech, Tito thanked his comrades for making the right choice and banding together against sectarian conflict. With the new mandate in hand, Marshal Tito has reorganized the communist party into the League of Communists, a party of equals of all the soon-to-be republics of the new Yugoslavia."
 twrserbia.27.d_2:0 "The elections have come to a close and there's no doubt about it; the core principles of Marxism-Leninism on which the communist party was founded have come out on top. As Rankovic took the stage to address the party that he now leads, he gave a long-winding speech about the future of socialism in the Balkans as a whole. Having pushed the incumbent Titoists aside, it would seem that the old status quo is once again tasked with the herculean task of bringing socialism to the Balkans."
 twrserbia.27.d_3:0 "This was perhaps the greatest electoral upset in the KPJ's history, as the hardline Marxists were defeated by Milovan Djilas' democratic socialists. Staring in pure shock, members belonging to the Titoist and Rankovici watched as Djilas accepted the mantle of party leader. Thanking his opposition for putting the people over pointless infighting and outdated concepts. Hoping to mend ties in the party in the goal of preserving Yugoslavia, it would seem that pragmatic reformism will guide Yugoslavia from now on."
 twrserbia.27.a:0 "Uz Marsala Tita, junackoga sina!"
 twrserbia.27.b:0 "Zivio narodni heroj!"
 twrserbia.27.c:0 "Za Djilasa i demokratiju!"
 
 twrserbia.28.t:0 "Letter from [From.GetName]"
 twrserbia.28.d:0 "We are ready to bury the hatchet, and offer a hand of reconciliation, because there are various threats that can befall us, namely those residing in Germany and Italy. Therefore, we want to offer you not a defensive pact, but a pact of mutual economic assistance."
 twrserbia.28.a:0 "Together we are stronger!"
 twrserbia.28.b:0 "We don't need [From.GetName]'s charity!"
 
 twrserbia.29.t:0 "[From.GetName] Joins the Pact!"

 twrserbia.29.a:0 "Welcome Comrades!"
 
 twrserbia.30.t:0 "[From.GetName] Declines Our Offer"
 twrserbia.30.d:0 "Our would-be friends have unfortunately not seen reason and have declined to join the Belgrade Pact."
 twrserbia.30.a:0 "If so they wish..."
 
 twrserbia.31.t:0 "Josip Broz Secures Re-election"
 twrserbia.31.d:0 "Serbia following the German invasion was never known to be a particularly stable country, rife with insurgents seeking to undermine the National Salvation government as well as each other. Following a devastating civil war and a chaotic consolidation of power, Josip Broz Tito has been re-elected by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia as President of the new republic. Seeking to end the foreign occupation of Yugoslavian territories altogether, Josip Broz has vowed to end the racial divides that plagued the old kingdom through the new principles of "Brotherhood And Unity" and a market socialist economy. Although Italy and Germany refuse to recognize what they see as a "Belligerent statelet run by bolshevik bandits", both the exiled government in London and the Toronto Accord as a whole have begrudgingly recognized the new state in the hopes of driving fascism out of Europe's most important junctions."
 twrserbia.31.a:0 "The marshal reigns supreme."
 
 twrserbia.32.t:0 "A Communist Coup!"
 twrserbia.32.d:0 "Today, Bulgarian communists backed by Yugoslavian forces operating from Pirot and Macedonia have launched a coup against our government, seeking to take over and enforce the principles of communism throughout the country. How should we respond?"
 twrserbia.32.a:0 "The tides of change shall wash over the government."
 twrserbia.32.b:0 "Communism has no place in Bulgaria!"
 
 twrserbia.33.t:0 "[From.GetName] wants Closer Ties"
 twrserbia.33.d:0 "A diplomatic request, an extremely rare occurrence these days, has arrived from Belgrade. The Yugoslavs wanted some kind of material help from the Soviet Union, something that could be seldom spared given the Union's current situation. Having a fellow socialist state wreck havoc in the Balkans would however be a significant boon to our aims in the future..."
 twrserbia.33.a:0 "We shall help our Slavic brothers."
 twrserbia.33.b:0 "Tell them we don't have the resources to spare."
 
 twrserbia.34.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accept our Offer"
 twrserbia.34.d:0 "Russia has accepted the reestablishment of friendship and close relations between our two countries. This is the dawn of a new age, as our two countries will defend each other against any who might threaten us. Without a doubt, this agreement is a victory not just for our respective governments, but for all of our peoples."
 twrserbia.34.a:0 "Together, to victory!"
 
 twrserbia.35.t:0 "[From.GetName] Decline Our Offer"
 twrserbia.35.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of our diplomats, the Russian government has refused our offer of friendship, treating us coldly despite the shared history of our countries.

"What did those bastards think of now?" Revealing the content of the document, he noticed the document, and only, the Kosovo issue signed by [FROM.GetLeader] personally, not some of his footmen, or someone similar to a swindler, but He.\n\n"Dear friend, a follower of Marxism, I am addressing you with this letter as a friend, and as a comrade-in-arms. It is time to bury the axes of war that existed among our peoples, and to turn to the future that is inexorably approaching us, Therefore, I wanted to offer you this agreement, to resolve the issue of Kosovo once and for all, which we have been fighting to win for a decade.\n\nI want to divide Kosovo, according to the principle of relations between the Serb and Albanian populations, by assigning Northern Kosovo to the Serb side, and assigning the South of Kosovo to the Albanians, establishing equal influence in both the South and the North. We will establish a Union of Serbian and Albanian municipalities on both sides, thus enabling the minorities in the South and the North to have a say in their way of life, so we look forward to your reply to the letter shortly.

After all, they thought he would get one sooner or later. "How nice of them to accept this, isn't it?" "Sorry if I ask a stupid question, but who accepted what?" Koca Popovic asked, visibly upset by the president's behavior this morning. "[FROM.GetLeader], my friend." Popovic has now begun to think that the president is not normal, but he soon switched to the fact that this is a proposal that the president mentioned. "Wait, did he accept the division?" "Yes, yes! How come you didn't realize it right away?" "Won't you be offended?" "What did you mean?" "That you got a nervous breakdown." Then the president thought. "You will end up in Tara one day, but today is not the day." "What do you want us to do?" "Send a delegation to Tirana, we will meet with them, revealing the contents of this document."

He knew who it was, and he knew what it was about? He had already started swearing nervously. "Son of a bitch!" Opening the letter, he saw his short answer NO! "I've suffered enough for you, you miserable excuse for the Illyrians." He then started looking for the Minister of War, it was known what would happen when the UN was angry.

"I apologize for the intrusion, but this is urgent." "What's so urgent about breaking into an office like this?" He threw a report from Pristina and Tirana, the president grabbed it, and immediately threw himself into reading. As his gaze slid toward the worse and worse news, his face grew redder and redder like a Mexican jalapeno. "What is this shit?" He asked him until Koca knew what he could say. He had no words.\n\n"I don't know, President, but the news is terrible, what should we do?" "I don't know, I don't know, I'm just thinking about it, but I just don't know how we could handle this." The president got up from his chair and walked back and forth, until a not-so-great, but the only idea came to his mind.\n\n"Don't tell me you've already figured it out because I know what idea came to your mind." "Popovic, there is no other left."\n\nLater that day, the JNA received information that troops were engaged in securing the borders of the South and North of Kosovo, as well as a protest note sent to Enver Hoxha, but the response never formally reached the Yugoslav authorities."

Everything was ready, and finally, the long-awaited report arrived, which was simplified for obvious reasons:\n\n"During the night, our agents sent reports stating that all Albanian politicians were either no longer active or active in terms of life.

"What do you have for me? Is it about Kosovo?" The counselor didn't say anything, he just handed the papers to Hoxha, who looked at him confused, believing that something bad had happened. "Trust me, if you managed to screw something up there, you're done with politics." The adviser still did not say anything, but stood still, sweating and thinking how Hoxha would react when he read that the Serbs had managed to take Kosovo from them.\n\nHoxha took the papers and lit them with a cigarette. "This document does not exist. It will never exist. Serbian Kosovo will never exist. Now listen to me. You have fucked up enough opportunities for me not to interfere with them. Now listen to me, and report this to the Minister of the Army. Let our troops guard the institutions of Southern Kosovo." and if the Serbs try something, you have the right to shoot at them.

"We don't need war now, we need peace, we need lasting peace." He thought to himself, and Koca put only two options in front of him. "The Albanians have just announced that they have annexed Kosovo." The president watched calmly. This time he was not angry, or depressed, which only happened when he drank, or anything else. He had no words now.\n\n"Please repeat that last sentence." He said quietly and briefly so that Koca would stand in the same position as when he first uttered this sentence. "The Albanians announced that they have annexed Kosovo." The president slammed his fist on the table, as the papers shattered, the whiskey spilled, and the embers of a cigarette fell out of the ashtray, igniting his book he was just reading. "That's why I saw the troops marching? Who permitted this shit?" "The Minister of War decided that it should be so. He said that you would order it that way, and he told all the troops to head in the direction of Kosovo, without questions, without answers, and without reason for war, except for churches and Serbs. So I came immediately with you to ask you for permission to wage war against the Albanians. You now have two options.

As evil never comes alone, a new counselor arrived and arrived at his office. And he just managed to overcome his anger problems. "Please, if it's bad news, you better shoot me." Then the counselor looked at him, thinking about it. "It was a rhetorical statement!" Hoxha defended himself and took in his hands, who knows exactly which way the bad news, and for who knows which way, he almost suffered a nervous breakdown due to that. Then he inhaled, and exhaled, imagining himself by the calm waterfall, but he still shot the counselor with a wooden ashtray, and luckily for the counselor, he had quick reflexes and Hoxha managed to break the aquarium and kill the fish.

The knife stood next to the President of Bulgaria, who was clichédly waiting to stab someone in the back. The president had a peaceful dinner of pork, which ran until yesterday before it met the Bulgarian knife. Next to it stood wine, with a sugar content of less than 4%. Then, an urgent dispatch reached the president, which was written in Serbian and Bulgarian. Fortunately, not a single word was lost in the translation. The president wiped his hands and mouth from the grease because the pig still weighed about 35 kilograms, which was ideal for a skewer. After wiping his hands, he opened a dispatch on which he signed on behalf of the president.\n\n"Dear and respected President of Bulgaria. For many centuries, our countries have bordered on each other, for better or for worse. I am sending you a letter in good faith so that we can agree as people on the burning issue of Pirot, and Macedonia, territories were taken away from us by the Ljubljana Award"\n\nThe Bulgarian president already knew what it was about, so he already knew what he was going to do.

Pirot and Macedonia, apart from history, have no significance for Bulgaria and its nation." Therefore, we will peacefully surrender those territories, but of course in exchange for trade agreements with Yugoslavia."\n\nAs he looked at the paper, he asked for another piece of paper and wrote; "History has shown that the Serbian nation, as well as the Yugoslav one, can never be trusted, that it will always stab the Bulgarian people in the back, like in 1913, when you joined forces with the enemy against us, trampled us, and rubbed your military boots with blood. History and honor are the only ones left for the Bulgarian nation, so we can't say anything except to reject your blatant proposal."\n\nAs he finished, he was silently looking at both papers and thought about which one to send as his official response.

Koca was confused, to shake his head, so he remembered why he came here. "President, this is not the time to measure personal beauty, Bulgarians!" The president massaged his tired face with gentle hand movements, to turn towards Koca. "What Bulgarians? What have they done now?" "You'll never guess!" "They agreed to the proposal for Pirot and Macedonia?" Koca was more confused than the transvestite in his brain when it came to gender until he decided what he wanted to be in the end, and then he raised his hand, with a questionable character. "How?" "Bulgarians are normal, they believe in prosperity..." "They killed Serbs in the First!" "You see Koca, we all make mistakes in a moment of passion." "Bulgarianization and killing when someone speaks Serbian is a mistake?" "We're not going to talk about it now, we're going to have a lot of opportunities to talk about it, not now, while Rankovic's bugs are eavesdropping on all the offices." "Why don't you arrest him?" "Then the nationalists would make a mess." "Fair." "We will send them a letter of heartfelt thanks and accept their condition of trade agreements.

The Hungarians fell for this trick, and ended up surrounded.\n\nAt this moment, the President decided to visit the place where the conflicts broke out on the borders, so that he could give his troops morale and strength to continue fighting, and that if the Hungarians do not give up their idea to keep Vojvodina under occupation, they will continue towards Budapest if they have to.\n\nThe Minister of War then ran into the President, carrying a dispatch in his hand, which was addressed to his name and the address of the Presidency.

Albania was cut in half near Durres and the siege of Tirana began, which lasted a short time for the simple reason that Albanian politicians realized that it was no longer worth giving their lives for the already lost war. Negotiations lasted for two days, and Kosovo now officially belonged to Serbia, while all Albanian nationalists were either killed or expelled from Albania, which created a peaceful current towards the Serbian government. With this agreement, Albania became a puppet of the Serbian authorities, and it could not decide on that issue arbitrarily, but was peace secured by this? Could anyone have known that? I do not think so."

An urgent recommendation from the commander of the Montenegrin garrisons arrived in Rome, directly to the command. "What is this?" One commander asked, entering with an emergency dispatch in his hand. "What's what?" The other commander would be confused, as he continued to read the newspaper, but pretended to listen to him, which was half true. "Where did she come from?" Then the commander turned the letter over again to see that Niksic was writing. "Montenegro?" As if he couldn't believe that something important was happening, which in translation means black mountain. "So you came in here for no particular reason, to tell me that Serbs with smaller brains are doing something?" "So when you compose a sentence like that, yes." "O Dio Mio." He said quietly, clutching his head, but since the job description guaranteed that he was in charge of such trifles, he had to take the letter and read it.\n\nWhen his hand grabbed the paper, it crumpled, because that makes sense for paper when you pick the paper up. "What does it say here?" The man, or commander, as many called him, just shrugged and said he didn't know, that he wasn't even looking. "O Dio Mio." Another man, the commander, as many called him, said again, and putting on his reading glasses, he began. A series of sentences in which Italian garrisons complained about frequent robberies, kidnappings carried out by ordinary peasants, disappearances of Italian soldiers and terrorist attacks on everything Italian says. "Hell... we're going to have to send an interventionist unit." "What it is?" "Do you have a vivid imagination?" "Please?" Then the other man realized what had occurred to him. "I see that your imagination works well, imagine a hillbilly who knows how to shoot but doesn't know how to talk." "It's an ordinary day in the Balkans, isn't it?"

Headed by the widely-feared Strahinja Janjic, this group of Nazi fanatics seeks to undermine everything Serbia holds dear. An insane abomination of Schutzstaffel occultist ideas and Serbian ultranationalism seeking to reject the Vodja and perhaps even God himself.

Snaking its way close to the city center and more importantly, the head of the government, this group of wannabe Hiterlists have one goal in mind, the end of the ZBOR party and their ascension to power.

 twrserbia.134.d:0 "His foot stood in front of the Presidency. His units were ready to attack. His name was justified this time. Strahinja Janjic. His face was directed towards Ljotic's office, where he snuck in after today's meetings with ZBOR, in which they discussed weapons. "All right. When he gives the signal, open fire on the windows." He said lightly, and put his hands behind his back, waiting for death. "SAD!" He said after ten seconds of silence, and the bursts began to cut the glass, to break through the walls in the offices, and some of the windows turned red, the color of blood. Janjic watched this scene carefully, with a smile. Then he started walking in the direction of the entrance, while massive chaos broke out in the premises of the Presidency, no one knew what was happening outside, and who was shooting it. Ljotic was in his office during the attack and pulled out his gun, which he had kept since the end of the civil war. Janjic was accompanied by two guards, who were carrying loaded machine guns, ready to meet their new victim, pale, cold, and completely dead. Janjic and the guards managed to break through the corridor of the Presidency, although no one offered any resistance, except for the ZBOR militia, which generally served as an ornament. Janjic managed to overcome them, skillful since his days in the special department of the Belgrade Gestapo, and to break their necks with just one strong and rough twitch. The guards just looked into his cold face, before they started walking in the direction of Ljotic's office. She was the key to this attack on the Presidency. Although they went at a slow pace, they did their job very quickly, considering that the first phase of the attack ended successfully, without the interference of Ljotic's elite forces, but only ordinary militia, which paraded as a decoration while standing. Strahinja's forces began to storm every room they came across and killed everyone who did not want to obey his wishes. The stairs then appeared in front of him, to pull out a gun, ready to kill Ljotic on the spot. On the other side, Ljotic was thinking about what he could do. He could not go through the window, because Strahinja's soldiers, who remained outside, surrounded every window that could serve as an exit. Ljotic had no choice but to inform ZBOR that an attack on the Presidency was taking place, that they had to be ready. Opening the door only a little, he could see his armed hands on the steps, and his face. It was him, the notorious sadist, torturer, and murderer, Strahinja Janjic. "Oh dear God..." He said, grabbing the closet with both hands, which he managed to move only out of panic and adrenaline, and threw it at the door, so he would buy himself some time. The only person he could get over the phone at the moment was Konstantin 'Kosta' Musicki, a general of the ZBOR formation. He waited for a while, listening to Strahinja's troops kill everyone in front of him, not sparing his ammunition, wasting only reason. "General Musicki, is that you?" "Yes. What's going on? Shots are heard in the city." "That maniac from the Serbian Gestapo, Janjic, attacked the presidency." On the other hand, Janjic could hear Ljotic's conversation, and Ljotic knew that very well. After another sentence, a short shot was heard. This was the end of ZBOR's rule and the moment when Janjic secured his power."

 twrserbia.135.t:0 "Musicki's Counteroffensive"
 twrserbia.135.d:0 "The answer arrived extremely quickly, at the same speed with which the zborasi were moving. Musicki saw the significance of this attack, from the moment when Ljotic uttered that cursed name. Janjic. He divided the more elite ZBOR units, which aimed to liquidate everyone who was with Janjic or at least supports his sick and twisted ideas. Musicki personally went with his troops, moving in the direction of the Presidency. It took them an hour to organize a counterattack, and arriving in front of the presidency, Janjic ordered fire at will. Janjic stood over the corpse of Dimitrij Ljotic, regretting that he could not dismember his neck, and left him to die, suffocating in blood. He walked down the hall, walking in the direction of the room on the second floor, which faced the fight. All the troops that used to attack the presidency have now formed a ring around the building. Musicki possessed more numerous forces, while Janjic's troops had a sick fanaticism for which they were ready to go to the very end. "Leave Constantine alive. I want to have fun with him after this." Janjic said, taking the rifle that one of his soldiers was carrying all the time. Musicki then launched an offensive in the direction of the building, when the first grenades flew in the direction of Musicki. "Back! Back!" He was speaking, when a series of explosions shook the earth. Knocked off his feet, he opened his eyes and could see his troops retreating, in front of the fire of Janjic's forces. Trying to get up, he could only see one thing. That someone's hands are pulling him in an unknown direction, and the butt that hits him in the middle of the face, leaving him unconscious, tonight. He woke up in a dark room, tied with a rope that left him with disgusting scars from the binding. He didn't know where he was, a blow to the head with a butt left him with no memory. He only knew that Ljotic was in trouble. He was alone in that room, expecting someone to come. "Hello!" He shouted with all his might. "Hello! Is anyone here? Hello!" He tried to shout with all his might, but he could not hear anyone. Then he heard a murmur and recognized two voices. He didn't know more than that. Then there were footsteps after the muttering stopped. Within ten minutes, the stepping came back and someone started unlocking. "Hurry up with that lock, I can't wear this head of his forever." Then he realized in whose hands he had fallen. Strahinja Janjic entered the room. "You! You damn, disgusting son of a bitch!" Then Janjic took Ljotic's severed head and showed it to him. A thousand emotions went through Musicki's head, to make him vomit. "If you tell me one more time that I'm a son of a bitch, I'll do this to you, just much, much worse." His voice sounded threatening, hissing like a snake defending its territory. "This is going to happen to your ZBOR. Oh..." He watched Musicki struggle with his emotions and stomach, after seeing a freshly cut head, from which blood was still dripping. "... you haven't killed innocent people in a long time? You haven't killed the unclean in a long time?" "Fuck you," Musicki said, trying to pull himself out, but the cable cut deep into his skin, and he started cutting his fists. "You can't get rid of Constantine, I didn't plan on letting you out of here, in any way." Then he pulled out a small, military knife, pointed at the tip, and slightly curved. It served as knots. "See this knife? It's normally intended for naval purposes, but it's extremely good when someone needs to have a mobile body removed." Musicki was no longer allowed to take risks, he started to fight, but without success, he failed to free himself. His body, later found in the Danube, had no eyes, teeth, ears... his head ended up on the bank of Kalemegdan, while the body was just found on Djerdap, with his arms and legs cut off. Not to mention the intimate parts."

Order returned to the streets, even after the battle, the people knew that if ZBOR lost the battle, they could do nothing more. It was calm early in the morning, as if the chaos around the Presidency, where the battle took place, and where the grenades were falling, never happened, and no one even wanted to remember, or remember the explosions from the previous night, mixed with screams...\n\nThe bus followed its standard route, heading towards Belgrade. Everything seemed to be going to be normal. Sitting in the bus, Ratko Parezanin read the newspaper he bought early in the morning, as he was leaving the bakery with plain bread and one small yogurt. There was nothing special about them, he knew that the newspapers were under control, but he had to be interested in something along the way, killing time. Suddenly everything went quiet, and someone started gunning the bus. Ratko fell to the ground, while blood was scattered on the seats, the roof, the floor, the faces... and the brains that were bursting with the force and speed of the bullets. Ratko was among the few who survived this attack. He did not know what had happened to him, he covered his head with a newspaper, while a scene passed through his head when his father was shot after the outbreak of the First World War, and before that, he was taken to the camp. He heard a shout, which commanded the troops to enter the bus, and searched it to the ground. Four soldiers, apparently from Janjic, stormed both entrances. Anyone who moved, or showed signs of life, was shot on the spot, and the soldiers did not show the slightest mercy to them.\n\nThe soldiers led a blood-stained Parezanin under someone's armpits, and threw him on the ground, in a dirty bar. "What are we going to do with him?" "The boss told us to do something brutal for him." "I have an idea. Bring the vending machines." Parezanin tried to grab his gun, but his hands slipped because of the mud. He did not try to escape, as soon as he heard that it was the boss, he knew that they would be killed sooner or later. Unsuccessfully trying to grab the gun, he was greeted by massive bursts that destroyed his internal organs, leaving him like someone with a five times bigger harrow with 100 wedges. He survived, surprisingly, the next minute after he was shot and his body was set on fire, along with a bus that had dozens of innocent civilians as passengers."

 twrserbia.137.d:0 "Although his efficiency and intelligence exceeded everyone's demonstrated ability in Ljotic's movement, Velibor Jonic never arrived as the first choice for anything. This remained the case even after the end of the European War after Ljotic assigned him an editorial office, where he would work for the state newspaper. The job was not demanding, but it was humiliating for a man of extraordinary, but also creepy abilities and opinions. So even now, in Janjic's idea, he was not the first choice for death.\n\nHaving received Janjic's confirmation that they may attack Jonic's position, the soldiers set out on their mission, moving towards the bus route, towards the bus in which one of Ljotic's associates, Ratko Parezanin, was, while for the second target, and the second in priority, again is Velibor Jonic. It was early morning, one could almost sense the dawn that would change everything. "Journalists" came to their work, as usual, filling vacancies in the newsroom, while Jonic was supposed to be there before everyone else, and to examine the quality of distorted facts, by knowing the facts and knowing how well the reality was spun. Nothing hinted at greater evil than when Dawn saw an armored vehicle stop in front of newsrooms, just as a journalist came to work to meet the sharper side of a knife that cuts to the bone, and stays if the killer is not interested in your life. "Are you ready?" "Yes."\n\nAll five bombs successfully flew through the windows, and gas began to be released from the bombs. The sounds of coughing, mixed with cries of dying, reached the soldiers who were waiting for everything to finally calm down so that they could pick up Jonic's body. The cough became unbearable if you had a hint of mercy. One could hear blood pouring down the pathos during a cough that sounded like an artillery barrage. One man reached the window, to spit bloody-mucous from his lungs, along with them, and during another bout of coughing, he rolled over the window, breaking his neck from hitting the wall, falling into his vomit, while the soldiers all they looked at it in cold blood, as if they had daily experiences with cases like this. Then they saw Jonic running like the last coward, with bloody lips and a bloody suit, falling, while the soldier grabbed him by the suit, and stabbed him in the throat, looking him directly in the eye, speaking.

"What's happening?" Djujic asked, quite calmly, not knowing that Janjic successfully overthrew the government. "Janjic. Strahinja Janjic. Serbian Gestapo." "Please?" Djujic did not understand what Opcan was saying, he spoke too fast, he spoke incomprehensibly. "What are you talking about, man?" "Janjic overthrew the government, you know that sadistic son of a bitch from the special police?" Djujic's fears passed, he didn't know how to talk, he just ran into the car as if he didn't know who he was talking to. Then two black cars drove out of the next street, and Opcan stepped on the gas in a panic and tried to escape. The chase around the city lasted for an hour until Janijc's mercenaries rammed Opcan's car, which crashed into the fence of the zoo, throwing Opcan through the windshield and driving him onto a broken fence spear, leaving him momentarily lifeless, while Djujic, a big man, managed to get stuck in the windshield and survive, though, sometimes surviving means experiencing an even worse fate. Opcan's body was stripped naked, and they placed it next to one of the cages, doing the same with Djujic while slapping him so he could wake up. Then, he opened his eyes.\n\n"Good morning, fiery beauty..." A soldier told him as zoo workers lay on the ground dead, after seeing armed soldiers placing naked men next to cages. "Shh..." Putting his hand over his mouth, he said, "Now it's time for some fun, you agree pope?" Then they turned him towards the soldier who was dragging Opcan's stabbed corpse into a cage with lions. Djujic stood paralyzed with fear, having no words to say at this moment. "You see now the fiery pope, the fun consists of this. You have a choice, I mean, to die, I certainly didn't mean to leave you alive, but to choose how disgusting you would shorten your death. Now that I'm your nickname from the degenerates. As he says, you're a fiery priest. And now you can choose whether we set you on fire alive, here... or you'll pass as your friend. A soldier carrying Opcan's lifeless body flew over the fence to the lions, who began to jump on his body, carving their teeth into his flesh, throwing him like a toy upwards, tearing his limb by limb, chewing the remains of his flesh, until nothing was left from the Municipality. "And you'll pass like this if you don't want to be burned alive.""

He glanced at the lions, who were playing with the last parts of the Municipality. He smiled, and that look of his met Djujic's. "Why?" The soldiers continued to pinch him with a rope, while Janjic put a smile on his face. "I enjoy this, this gives me the vitality to kill all of you degenerate individuals of the human species. This is a party, Mr. Vatreni, this is what Serbia will look like one day after we clean it of every trace of dirt and degeneracy in which it rolls." The fire was huge because the soldiers poured gasoline leftover from Opcan's car. The screams that Djujic let out were equal to the demonic screams that Dante described in "Hell." After ten seconds, ten awful seconds, the demonic screaming stopped."

Janjic pounded his fists on the table, and Ljotic's head fell to the ground, rolling. "How many times have I sent them that fucking letter and they didn't deign to say at least something to me, or to respond with one, little, fucking letter in the letter. You know what, Ljotic? This has gone beyond any measure!" Janjic continued to run around the office, angry and nervous as never before. "Don't you? You don't think the fucking idea came to my mind that they didn't get the letter?" Ljotic is watching. "They must have seen, laughed, and thrown the letter into the fire, like all those people they killed after the war!" Ljotic does not believe, but he is watching. "YOU!" He pointed a finger at his skull, now on the verge of a nervous breakdown. "Tell me! How do I handle this?" His head did not move, he just continued to look at him coldly, without any sign. "NO! NO! NO! How many times have your fucking skull had to tell you that it could never have gone that way! I won't! Stop talking to me!" People gathered in front of the office, listening with fear to this furious rant that was coming. "What's going on inside?" Svetozar Necak asked. "His head seems to be saying something he doesn't want to hear." Another member of the Presidency told him. Then, there was silence. No one could hear Janjic shouting. "I'm going in." Said Svetozar, opening the door slightly, and like an uninvited Satan, he went inside. "I apologize if I bothered..." Janjic laughed hysterically as if he had just heard a good joke. "You know what, Svetozar? The Germans have humiliated our Aryan comrades too much. I think that's enough for them now. We'll have to do everything ourselves." He just had a nervous breakdown.

Then they were all taken out in front of the square. In further battles, in other parts of the city, smoke was seen from the direction of the square. In mass confusion, Rankovic's army, with the support of loyalist students, managed to push the reformists into a corner and to punish them mercilessly. It was never recorded what exactly happened to them. During the second day of heavy fighting, a wide part of Belgrade was destroyed, but Rankovic managed to win, arrest, and not to mention the further atrocities he did with the defeated soldiers.

He was not allowed to speak, he felt as if someone was watching. While looking for anything suspicious, he noticed a screw, a small, metal screw on the floor, and took it in his hands. He was like the one used to assemble a table, a chair, and things like that, so he continued to search the office with light steps, looking for the missing screw.\n\nAfter ten minutes of searching, he established one fact. The potholder was loose. He could see something small, tiny. "Damn you son of a bitch."

"Hell, I'll be right there, call a meeting." "I understand, Mr. Rankovic." The connection was broken and he got up instantly from his chair. "Listen to me!" All eyes were on him. "Mr. Rankovic has just called an emergency meeting on the next issue. We have lost contact with Milovan Djilas' office." "How?" "No one knows that yet, but we're considering two obvious options." "All right, I'll make sure they come." The other UDBA's then immediately went about his business, while he was followed by the man who received this news, that the eavesdropper was not working.\n\nDjilas decided to leave the office, and not to tell anyone what was happening, because that would compromise him. He had to take this out of political circles, and he had a friend with whom he could consult. Matija Beckovic was an interesting person, a talented poet, and an intellectual with whom Milovan hung out. Now, maybe he was his only salvation because you can never trust politicians and commissioners. Matija was waiting for him in a tavern, where Djilas wrote the idea of "New Thought", which he wanted to present as a reformist. "Matija, I'm glad you waited for me. I need to talk to you urgently." "What's the matter, you sounded scared when you called me." Then he showed him the eavesdropper, which Matija took in his hands. "German? Where did this come from?" "From my office. Looks like UDBA's sons of bitches decided to eavesdrop on me." "These are Milovan's grave accusations... are you quite sure when you say that?" "Of course, I think that it was Rankovic's work." "How can you talk like that?" "Because I know Matija, I know how that maniac thinks. We camped together in the woods and mountains, of course, I'll know." "Okay, okay, suppose you're right. How did you mean to come out with this?" "I don't know, I meant to ask you. You understand that better than I do." "Damn me if I can give you the answer you're looking for, but I'll try to help somehow." "Thank you, find me in my apartment.

He always carried with him a lighter that Tito gave him on the day of the liberation of Yugoslavia, and he decided to burn all this so that he could not reveal his location where he could allegedly disappear. Then he threw the lighter into a drawer overflowing with papers, and the smoke appeared first so that the fire would transform them into ashes. There was nothing left, and Djilas' office found itself on fire, so strong that no one had a chance to survive.

He took one blank book, in which he connected all the pages he had typed earlier, reviewing everything that had been done so far.\n\nEverything that has been done so far has been reversed by Rankovic's police-UDBA action.

You hit a rock, you break it, you hit a rock, you break a cramp, you hit a rock with what you get. It doesn't matter if you break it or not, you hit a fucking rock until midnight when they whip you with whatever they can get, or until you fall asleep, or until you die.

"You can let him go." Curtin nodded and let Mr. Cooper in. "Good afternoon, Mr. Djilas." "Good afternoon, Mr. Harold, Curtin told me the reason for your visit." As Curtin closed the door, Djilas went to the table to pick up a ballpoint pen. Cooper took a small bottle of liquid content, a tablet that looked like cyanide, out of his pocket, put on his gloves, and snuck up behind Djilas. He put the tablet in a soaked cloth, and snuck up to Djilas, snapping him and stuffing the cloth into his mouth. Djilas swallowed the pill and due to the action of the liquid, he fell asleep. "It's time for bed, Mr. Djilas, it's time for bed." Milovan Djilas, a fierce opponent of Aleksandar Rankovic, was killed in a London asylum. He published several books, the most famous of which were "Memoirs of a Yugoslav" and "Investigation of the Yugoslav Cultural Revolution", and left behind a widow and two children. His legacy and his work created a new movement, which opposed Aleksandar Rankovic, promising him revenge for the work done. They are called, djilasovci."

He had to continue to fight because in his heart and mind he believed that the communists would destroy and tear apart the country for which his Chetniks were fighting. He packed the necessary things in a bag, closed it, and set off on foot towards Montenegro in the hope that he would reach his forces that remained there to fight. He calculated how long it would take for the topic to arrive, hoping for a two-week trip as the most acceptable and best scenario for him. Leaving the city, he looked back once more, shedding a small, male tear and greeting him, hoping for a victorious return to Belgrade. The journey lasted about ten days, Draza spent all that time on his feet, making short but invigorating breaks that meant life. Forests appeared in front of him and mountains behind them, he believed that Montenegro was behind them, and he continued to steps in their direction.\n\n"Why are we on patrol today? Shouldn't Svetozar and Ilija have been on patrol?" "Do you want to stop whining every minute about how you have to stand in one place?" "Do you have to judge me for that?" "Would you shut up if I told you yes?" "Fair." The conversation ended immediately, and there was an unpleasant silence that ruined all plans. "Do you hear that?" "What now? The silence bothers you?" "No, no, no, not that. It's like coming out of the woods." "It might be a fox, or maybe a bear." He said. "Say what you want, but I'm going to check." "Idiot..." He murmured as his friend headed for the woods. Draza managed to cross a stream and head towards the border, when he saw an armed guy, not more than 20 years old, approaching his direction. Draza was a striking figure, it was impossible not to recognize him. The guy raised his rifle and fired one shot, hitting Draza directly in the heart. Grasping his heart, he fell into the mud and the dust. "Come here!" The guy shouted while Draza let out his last signs of life. He was trying to say something, looking up at the sky, already crying, because he knew it was over for him. By the time the duo reached him, he was already dead, his eyes closed, his mouth too. He laid still, yet sad, remembering what he had fought for.\nDusty, muddy and bloody, they dragged him to a hill that was right next to the patrol house. They took shovels with them and started digging a hole. "Bury him upright." "Why?" "Bury him like that, and then we'll leave some space somewhere near the end, and put that fox we killed by mistake in that hole." "You're not clear to me sometimes." Throwing Draza like a dead animal into a hole, lumps of earth and sand-covered his lifeless body until his weeping face, covered in blood, could not be seen. Draza's grave was never found, for this duo had forgotten where they had buried him."

Puric knew that Mihailovic could not be saved after this. As the people parted so that the police could pass with Mihailovic again, he saw his family and his son watching him. Approaching them, he knelt and kissed his son. "Take care." Caressing his head, he kissed him again, and said to the woman, "Be strong." As she looked at him proudly, as he left with the police."

The engineer was watching them, speechless, but he had his orders. "Look now... just..." He swallowed a soft lump in his throat and pressed the button.

The Himalayas appeared before them. Indian - Nepalese - Tibetan natural border. It was rumored that someone managed to climb to the top of Mount Everest, but those stories have now become a legend. Many tried, no one succeeded. The frozen corpses remained there, no one to remove them. Their icy tomb was now their only friend in the afterlife. Before Janjic's expedition, he now faced perhaps the most difficult task so far. It was necessary to survive the cold that these mountain ranges offered. They did not offer much choice - to survive or die. There was no other.\n\nOn the second day of crossing the mountain range, he began to take the victims. A few of them did not have the luck and strength to cope with the cold. Janjic just looked at them, to say; "Degenerative weaklings, they are not worthy of Perun's and the Serbian name.""

The cold that was felt in the bones of the team did not allow them to perform any longer searches, although it was not recommended that the Serb hang on the Tibetan plateau and look for a connection between the Indo-European tribes and the Serbian tribes that were created by mixing. Janjic's idea, ie. the theory was that the Serbs came at the same time as the invasions of Indo-European tribes moving in the direction of Iran and Iraq, to end up in Turkey as well. Ljotic's idea, Janjic's theory. An inseparable duo.\n\nNow he, too, was beginning to feel cold, and his lack of heart and brain cells had helped him not to freeze.

They realized they had to retreat. But a dim light appeared in front of Janjic's eyes, he couldn't believe he felt the heat. He could have survived, but at what cost? A charred body in archbishop's clothes with a long, straight beard and a calm look appeared in front of him. "Rastko?" Janjic said, rising from the frozen ground and looking at Rastko Nemanjic's charred body. "It's me. Come on. I have something to tell you. It's extremely important." He told him in a calm, monastic voice that it was okay, that it was safe. "Say. I'm listening to you. I see you." Janjic spoke. "You have to save Serbia. You have to save Serbia because you are the only one who can do it now." "How?" "Go back to your roots. Go back to your roots, because Serbian consciousness is nothing if it is not returned to its roots." "Do you believe me?" Janjic will be confused, not expecting such a course of the dialogue. "Learn from my mistakes. Learn from my mistakes, because they will help you understand where you went wrong. My name is not Sava, nor Rastko, my name is Rastislav, like back in the days when we didn't know what God was, and who he was Son. Even when we knew that every part of nature is ruled by one God.

People watched him with pleasure, how he was sweating, how he was struggling, how he was looking at people who were supposed to die on his orders. He hit the glass, but no one wanted to release him. His face began to melt, to disintegrate, as he screamed from the pain he had suffered during this torture. Smoke began to appear from it, then fire. "I don't think it was a smart idea to pour gasoline on him. He'll die quickly and... RUN!" The people fled, and the oven exploded, scattering Janjic's remains all over the bakery.

That is when the chaos in Zagreb began when the Croatian inhabitants began to attack all the Serbian soldiers who were here in stampedes. The massive massacre began to take place in the streets of Croatia, and the soldiers tried to escape headlong, rushing towards the border, just not to fall into the hands of the angry people they had been harassing until now. Then they successfully freed themselves from all restraints, and invaded the military garrisons, looting everything in front of them, and killing everything in front of them, which in their heads thought in the Nazi language and walked in Serbian. At that time, all government buildings occupied by the Serbian authorities were stormed, and new republics were proclaimed, which caused only one domino to fall and collide with another, causing a chain reaction that brought Croatia into chaos, just like in Serbia. .

Today, the hunt was a little different, they went for pheasants in early October. Tito was the first to strike from the group that went with him, and several of his most loyal hunting dogs were supposed to collide into the water if a pheasant fell there. Tito could never see, well he did not wear glasses for nothing, but he loved hunting out of principle. He was followed by other bitches, politicians, who treated him half-heartedly. In one of the hunts, Tito raised his shotgun and fired one bullet at the pheasant that had just taken off, so a large flock of pheasants rose from the reeds, raising birdsong, while Broz watched them sadly as the pheasants flew.\n"Why are you looking for charisma in yourself, stuffed bird?"

Following the announcement of the proclamation to the Ministry of Construction, which stated; "each of the selected builders of this building must be carefully examined for the government to be safe in the event of information leaking to the public."\nThat's how it was done. In the vicinity of the Neretva River, there were three outposts under the camouflage of ordinary houses in which soldiers were sent by the Minister of the Army to guard the terrain while the foundations for a personal nuclear bunker were being laid. The plan was for the bunker to consist of 12 blocks and several rooms that reached 100. The most important blocks were 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11 - communication, Tito's bedroom, air filtration, fuel, and water. Furthermore, this bunker was intended for the political elite of the ruling Communist Party, and the number of people was 350 of them, together with Tito's family and his mistress, Jovanka, with whom, as it was said, he had an illegitimate child.\nThis endeavor required a lot of money that Serbia did not have a moment in its reserves, and the manipulation of the terrain was one of the main questions posed to Josip Broz and to which he gave only short and clear answers that did not lead anywhere. How Tito will approach the payment of this endeavor remains the question of who should be given."

Putting his bag aside and taking a small piece of bread out of his bag along with the binoculars given to him for use during the shift, he cast only one glance across the border. He noticed that one duo was moving at an accelerated pace towards the border. Stretching his weapon, holding it tight, he pointed in their direction, constantly watching what they were doing. After a brief observation, he noticed a woman trying to escape them, but no one was around to help her, just death chasing after her. Unable to do anything, he watched as they caught up with the woman and knocked her to the ground, beating her with locked rifles. Swallowing the dumpling in his throat, he could only watch them pull their knives towards the throat of the woman who was fighting for her life, grabbing them, hitting them into their stomach and intimate parts just to get a new escape. He hoped that she would be able to cross the border to help her, but now he couldn't do anything. Banat soldiers, like ordinary animals, cut a woman who did not want to surrender with a knife, dragging her with them.\n\nAnother day on the Banat border. Nothing has changed."

Because of the diversity of support for the Partisans and the German's intervention, we have a treasure trove of firearms to examine from many different countries.

 twrserbiajanjicspecial.14.t:0 "The Worst is Over"
 twrserbiajanjicspecial.14.d:0 "Trying to explain his intentions and his actions that terrorized Belgrade in the previous weeks, Svetozar Necak went out in front of the people who surrounded the Presidency for the second time to buy some time, although he knows that time is not wasted, he had to buy time until his plan did not come true. "Listen to me, people, now we can breathe a sigh of relief, you know why? Because the worst is over! That's why. So you are free to disperse and let me clean up the dirty work that Janjic has done to this country." It was his words, before he went inside, completely sweaty, managing to avoid a lynching that threatened to destroy everything he was fighting for now. "I don't have time. I have to do this abruptly." He picked up the phone and called someone. "I need your help." Desperate times call for Aryan measures."

 twrserbiajanjicspecial.15.d:0 ""Why did we meet so late at night?" The Apostles asked the Nephew one by one, while he was reading some papers.\n\n"I needed your help." He said briefly, tapping his fingers in nervousness, ready to wait for something that was never coming.\n\n"About what? Will you at least tell us what you need help with?"\n\n"Mostly some military relief, and the release of some soldiers to death."\n\n"Oh my God, can't you do it alone, someone had to call the whole company here?"\n\n"I need your help because we did this together. Do we? Or don't we?"\n\nThen a smoke bomb flew in, which frightened everyone except Svetozara Necak, who nonchalantly got up and left the room, while the knives cut the necks of all the Apostles who were here.\n"Did you manage to find the others?"\n"We are."\n"Units sent?"\n"Yes."\n\nSvetozar laughed, and when everyone went inside, he threw in 'tear gas'."

 twrserbiajanjicspecial.16.t:0 "The End of the Line"
 twrserbiajanjicspecial.16.d:0 "It was night, around 9 pm, and the chosen target was in a restaurant with his wife. At that time, the restaurant was full of civilians, and some members of the Nazi army, but no one suspected that the Aryan Brotherhood was approaching them. They stood not far from the restaurant, loading their rifles. "What did they order? Are we targeting or?" "No. Just shoot what you see." "Are we going to shoot at civilians?" "Such is the order." He said, when he flew out of hiding, and opened fire on the restaurant, while the windows were shattering and fragments of the same material were shooting at people. The first bullet immediately hit the target man, but the matter got out of control because even though they were fighting for the Serbian part and the people, killing became fun for them over time. The massacre took approximately 130 lives.\n\nAt the gas station, one of the cars driven by one of the Apostles stopped to refuel. An expedition of two stopped in front. "What do you think?" "I think fuel is too expensive." "What?" "What?" "I mean, how do we kill him?" "Um... I only have a grenade." "Where's your gun?" "Uhm..." Making a facepalm, his friend pulled out a grenade. "Aim. Strongly. Carefully." He said during the break, and the grenade flew in the direction of the car but bouncing off the roof, it fell not far from the fuel. The explosion of fire swallowed the station, while damage was caused on the road, in which a chain collision occurred. "I mean..." "Shut up." "But..." "Shut up."\n\nMassive victims are also coming in massive actions, Svetozar Necak knew as he looked at the sky, listening to the shooting, explosion, screams, handling knives, and other abominations that engulfed Belgrade tonight. "She is dying, she is dying, mother, Serbia, our homeland, all her children are crying with her, while the dead soul is sobbing..." Svetozar sang as he got into the car. "... they will never see flowers grow again, but candles that shine, kill new ones for life...""

 twrserbiajanjicspecial.17.t:0 "A Cross for an Apostle"
 twrserbiajanjicspecial.17.d:0 "Watch the threads of the allusion penetrate the consciousness, and the anxiety as a silent witness is not worth too much. He stood bloody beside the car, throwing himself like a rag doll, like yesterday, when his friends, along with too many civilians, died in the worst torments. One man noticed that Svetozarev's car was going at full speed towards the exit of the city, so at his own expense, he managed to drive his car off the road. Maybe my hunch is cheating, maybe I'm imagining, he wanted everything to end happily. Svetozar Necak never thought that everything would end happily. If it all starts in a bloody way, the bloodier can only end. There is no middle ground. "I got it! The brutal maniac is in my hands!" The man fought when the people, already terrified for their lives, saw in the hands of the national hero Zeljko, Svetozar Necak, the man responsible for the massacres earlier in the evening. They ran like the happiest moments of life that come very, very rarely, to greet him with knives, axes, saws, screwdrivers... and much, much worse devices.\n\n"What are we going to do with him?" "They are Apostles?" "Yes? What do you mean?" "I'm going to need a cross." Taking him away, stabbed, stabbed, they threw him to the ground, still using knives, taking care not to kill him to wait for their fate. A group of people carried a cross on their backs, which was intended for this solemn manifestation. The morning was shrinking behind the clouds, and the sun's rays finally greeted Belgrade, for the first time since Janjic's attack on Ljotic. Svetozar knew what was in store for him, he no longer had the strength to resist. "What now?" "As before, we will nail him alive to the cross, and then dismember him. He deserved such a disgusting death." "How do you think we'll split it?" "Like the Byzantines of Andronicus in 1185, I'll show you," Zeljko said, while they were laying the cross on which they laid Svetozar and they started hammering nails into his hands and feet. Svetozar has already survived a lot, he didn't pay attention to the pain anymore, he didn't feel it. "Now what?" "Lift him to the Danube, and whoever has balls, let him saw him." Several people showed up to do so, their families were killed in last night's attacks, seeking revenge. "Here you go," said Zeljko, without questioning the motives of two boys and one woman. "Who can't watch, we understand." Several people turned around, already sick of hammering nails into Svetozar, to hear the saw pierce human flesh, cutting it lightly, and that sound mingled with Svetozar's screams, which soon stopped. The brutal maniac is dead. The shots and explosions echoed for the second time, and the wind obscured the sun again. The sky above Belgrade became dark again when the Presidency was blown up, and a new war began."
