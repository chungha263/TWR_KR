 twrcitiesfall.1.d:0 "Victorious German soldiers march through the streets of London after fierce fighting that had lasted for many days. Due to extensive artillery bombardment, London was heavily damaged by the fighting, with strategic infrastructure sabotaged in an effort of slowing the German advance. A great number of buildings collapsed from the raging battle, and urban fires are left to burn due to the Government's evacuation.\nBuckingham Palace had already been evacuated before the British retreat, being the hardest stronghold of London before the total annihilation of the Queen's Guard, as the Palace of Westminster, already evacuated by Parliament, also fell. For now, Buckingham Palace has been repurposed to serve as the Military Governor's Office. In the maze of tunnels of the London Underground, sporadic fighting is thought to continue, but on the surface, the guns have fallen silent."

 twrcitiesfall.3.d:0 "Despite the utmost bravery and resistance by the American forces, New York City, the greatest shining symbol of American freedom, has fallen to the German tide. The fighting was fierce within the city, with citizen militias and soldiers alike armed to the teeth against the German invasion. But, with the overwhelming tide of German bombardment and a series of naval landings around the coast, the important stronghold of Fort Hamilton was taken, opening a path for the Germans to enter the city in full force. Urban warfare within Manhattan caused great casualties on both sides. Notably, the perimeter of the Empire State Building was heavily defended, but any efforts were ultimately futile in stopping the Germans.\n\nIn a few hours, the fighting gradually ceased, with the Germans emerging as the ultimate victors."

 twrcitiesfall.5.d:0 "As Soviet troops celebrated in front of the Reichstag, the Red Army has effectively secured themselves a victory in 'Germania' or Berlin. Under the leadership of [SOV.GetLeader], the years of humiliation and oppression have been washed away, as the Soviet Union returns in strength in the unlikeliest of ways. The fighting in Germania was fierce, with locations such as the Reich Chancellery, the Reichstag and the Germania Zoo being major points of contest. With the desparate situation, the majority of forces defending Germania were injured soldiers, the elderly, and the youth. These fanatics fought desperately against those they regarded as 'Slavic hordes' regardless of their age or sex, but their lack of experience turned them into nothing more than targets for even the ragtag Soviet forces, while experienced German troops were by now few.\nBehind the facade of victory, thousands lay lifeless on the sidewalks. As tragic victims of this brutal war."

 twrcitiesfall.7.d:0 "Not long ago, the residents of Washington D.C were faced with heavy bombardment, followed by a gruesome battle against the invading Germans. The perimeter of the Capitol was heavily contested, with members of the Secret Service mounting a last stand within the White House, fighting from hall to hall, room to room, withstanding all bombardments and attack while refusing to surrender until their total annihilation.\n\nThe majority of important documents, artifacts of the United States of America had been safely evacuated alongside the President and his administration. President [USA.GetLeader] issued his statement to the shattered nation, calling the loss of D.C as the United States' \"darkest moment\", reassuring all citizens that the fallen shall never be forgotten."

 twrcitiesfall.9.d:0 "Cheering with the chants of democracy and freedom, the American forces utilized the combined arms tactic and heavy bombardment to devastate any points of resistance before taking control of the so-called 'World City of Germania'.\n\nThe Battle of Germania took a staggering number of lives on both side. causing both civilian and military casualties. The perimeter around the Chancellery saw an intense amount of action, with reports detailing a full-day long artillery bombardment performed by one of the two sides during the peak of street combat.\n\nThousands are now displaced or dead, and the once glorious image of the Greater Reich has faded into memories of bombardments and devastation. In a desparate press statement, Nazi officials call for 'total resistance' against the invaders and have enacted a new wave of scorched earth policy in major German cities."

 twrcitiesfall.11.d:0 "The Fall of Moscow during the First German-Soviet War meant that the Soviets had to relocate their political center to the /"far-away land/" of Perm. But, this former bastion has fallen, and the temporary strongholds built to replace Moscow have been converted into German strategic positions.\n\nWhile the Russians have failed to hold the city, their courageous efforts have saved many natives, defending the evacuation of many citizens and government personnel. Soviet artifacts that were present in Perm are also evacuated to unknown locations, as the Russians' desperate attempt at making the impact of this development as minimal as possible. Germany has declared the capture of Perm as a great victory of the Aryan race, signalling the "Asiatic horde" is coming to an end, as the Aryans are one step closer to eradicate their archnemesis."
